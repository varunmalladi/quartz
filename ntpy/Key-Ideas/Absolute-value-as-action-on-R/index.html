Equivalently, any nonconstant polynomial $P\\in K[T]$ is of degree 1.\n\n**Proposition.** Suppose $K$ is algebraically closed. Then if $K\\subset L$ is an algebraic extension, $K=L$.\n\n# Properties\n1. Every finite field extension is algebraic.\n	1. There exist infinite algebraic extensions\n2. Every finitely generated algebraic field extension is finite.\n3. If $K$ is generated by (any finite number of) algebraic elements, then $K/k$ is algebraic.\n4. Suppose $L/K$ and $K/k$ are both algebraic (not necessary finite). Then $L/k$ is finite.\n5. Any endomorphism of an algebraic extension is an automorphism.\n\n### Proofs\n#### 1\nLet $F\\subset E$ be a finite field extension. Then for $\\alpha\\in E$, the powers of $\\alpha$ are not all linearly independent, for otherwise $E$ would be an infinite dimensional field extension. Then we can write a linear equation in some variables $a^i$ with nonzero coefficients (in $F$) that equals 0. This shows that $\\alpha$ is the root of a polynomial in $F[x]$. \n\nAn example of an infinite algebraic extension is the subfield of the complex numbers containing all algebraic number over $\\mathbb{Q}$ (as an extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$)\n#### 2\nIf $K$ is generated by one element, then $K=k(\\alpha)$. Since $K$ is algebraic, $\\alpha$ is an algebraic element and so we can apply (Property 2) and (Example $k_P$) to see that $K$ is finite. Now assume $K=k(\\alpha,\\beta)$. Then $[K:k]=[k(\\alpha,\\beta):k(\\alpha)][k(\\alpha):k]$ which is finite. We are done by induction.\n#### 3\nObserve that if $\\alpha$ is algebraic over $k$ and $F$ is an extension of $k$, and also $\\alpha\\in L$ and $F\\subset L$ for some field $L$, then certainly $\\alpha$ is algebraic over $F$. We can apply this to our situation by observing that there is a tower\n$$\nk\\subset k(\\alpha_1)\\subset k(\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2)\\subset\\cdots\\subset k(\\alpha_1,\\dots,\\alpha_n).\n$$\nEach extension is algebraic over the previous, and by (Property 2) each extension is finite. Hence $k(\\alpha_1,\\dots,\\alpha_n)$ is finite over $k$ by (Of dimensions, Property 1). By (Property 1) this implies it is an algebraic extension over $k$.\n#### 4\nLet $\\alpha\\in L$. It is by assumption algebraic over $K$, hence the root of a polynomial $P_{\\alpha,K}\\in K[T]$. Let $k_1$ be the subfield of $K$ generated over $k$ by all coefficients of the polynomial $P_{\\alpha,K}$. Then $$k\\subset k_1\\subset k_1(\\alpha).$$ By (General, Property 2) the second extension is finite, and by (Property 2) the first extension is also finite. So by (Of dimensions, Property 1) we have that $k_1(\\alpha)/k$ is finite, hence algebraic. So $\\alpha$ is algebraic over $k$.\n#### 5\nIt suffices to show the endomorphism $\\sigma:K/k\\to K/k$ is surjective, since any field homomorphism is injective. Let $\\alpha\\in K$, and $\\alpha=\\alpha_1,\\dots,\\alpha_n$ be the roots of $P_\\alpha$. By (Property 3) this is a finite extension. We also note that $\\sigma(k(\\alpha_1,\\dots,\\alpha_n))\\subset k(\\alpha_1,\\dots,\\alpha_n)$ because by (Of morphisms, Property 1) a root of $P_\\alpha$ must map to a root of $P_\\alpha$, and $k(\\alpha_1,\\dots,\\alpha_n)$ contains all such elements by construction. But $\\ker\\sigma=0$. So $\\sigma$ is injectively mapping between two finite dimensional vector spaces, hence $\\sigma$ is an isomorphism when restricted to these vector spaces. In particular $\\alpha\\in\\text{im}\\sigma$, so $\\sigma$ is surjective.\n\n# Related\n- [Field extension](notes/ntpy/Definitions/Algebraic Number Theory/Field Theory/Field extension.md)",lastmodified:"2022-01-27T04:08:13.216681499Z",title:"Algebraic extensions"},"/notes/ntpy/Definitions/Algebraic-Number-Theory/Field-Theory/Algebraically-closed-field":{content:"**Pre-definition.** A field $L$ is called _algebraically closed_ if and only if any polynomial in one variable with coefficients in $L$ splits to a product of factors of degree 1.

Every irreducible polynomial in $k[T]$ which has a root in $K$ splits into linear factors in $K$\n\n# Properties\nLet $K_1$ and $K_2$ be field extensions over $k$, and $\\sigma: K_1/k\\to K_2/k$ a homomorphism of extensions. Let $P\\in k[T]$. \n\n1. ([Zariski's lemma](notes/ntpy/Theorems/Field Theory/Zariski's lemma.md)) \n2. Let $\\alpha\\in K$ be algebraic over $k$. Let $P_\\alpha$ be a monic irreducible polynomial such that $P_\\alpha(\\alpha)=0$. Then\n	1. $P_\\alpha$ exists and is unique\n	2. $k_{P_\\alpha}\\cong k(\\alpha)\\cong k[\\alpha]$\n\n### Proofs\n#### 2\nCertainly $P_\\alpha$ exists. We just need to show it is unique. By decomposing and dividing, we can assume that $P_\\alpha$ is irreducible and monic. Suppose $Q$ is another monic irreducible polynomial such that $Q(\\alpha)=0$. Suppose $Q\\neq P_\\alpha$. Then by the Euclidean algorithm  $P_\\alpha G+QH=1$ for some $G,H\\in k[T]$. This is impossible, since $P_\\alpha(\\alpha)=Q(\\alpha)=0$. Hence $P=Q$. \n\nWe first show that $k_{P_\\alpha}\\cong k[\\alpha]$. Consider the map\n\n\\begin{gather}\n\\phi:k[T]\\to K \\\\\n\\phi_k= 1_k \\\\\nT\\mapsto \\alpha.\n\\end{gather}\n\nClearly $\\text{im}\\phi=k[\\alpha]$. Then \n$$\n\\phi(P_\\alpha(T))=P_\\alpha(\\phi(T))=P_\\alpha(\\alpha)=0.\n$$\nSo $P_\\alpha\\in\\ker\\phi$. Thus there is a surjection $$\\bar{\\phi}:k[T]/(P_\\alpha)\\to k[\\alpha]$$. This is actually also injective since it is a field homomorphism: the domain is a field (see Example 1). It is the definition of $k_{P_\\alpha}$. \n\nThat these are isomorphic to $k(\\alpha)$ is a matter of definition: $k(\\alpha)$ is the minimal subfield of $K$ containing $k$ and $\\alpha$, where $k[\\alpha]$ is the minimal subring with the same property. We have just shown that $k[\\alpha]$ actually a field, so the two notions coincide.\n\n## Of morphisms\n1. Algebraic elements are sent to algebraic elements.\n	1. If $P(\\alpha)=0$ for some $\\alpha\\in K_1$, then $P(\\sigma(\\alpha))=0$.\n2. Let $K=k_P$. Then a homomorphism $\\sigma:K/k\\to L/k$ uniquely extends to a ring homomorphism $\\tilde{\\sigma}:k[T]\\to L$ that fixes $k$ and $P(\\tilde(T))=0$. \n	1. In this case the set $\\sum_{K/k}^{L/k}$ coincides with the set of different roots of $P(T)$ in $L$.\n	2. Conversely, a root of $P(T)$ in $L$ determines a homomorphism of field extensions.\n3. Suppose $k\\subset M\\subset K$ where $K=M(\\alpha)$ with $\\alpha$ algebraic over $M$. Let $L/k$ be algebraically closed. Then any element $\\sigma\\in\\sum_{M/k}^{L/k}$ could be extended to an element of $\\sum_{K/k}^{L/k}$: $$ \\begin{array} zM/k \u0026 \\rightarrow \u0026 L/k \\\\ \\downarrow \u0026 \\rlap{{}^\\exists}{\\nearrow} \u0026 \\\\ K/k \u0026 \u0026 \\end{array} $$\n4. Suppose $K/k$ is algebraic (not necessarily finite), $L/k$ algebraically closed. Then $\\sum_{K/k}^{L/k}$ is nonempty. If both $K/k$ and $L/k$ are algebraic and algebraically closed then any $\\sigma\\in\\sum_{K/k}^{L/k}$ is an isomorphism.\n	1. Compare with (Of algebraic field extensions, Property 5).\n\n### Proofs\n#### 1\nWe have \n$$\nP(\\alpha)=a_0+a_1\\alpha+\\cdots+a_n\\alpha^n = 0.\n$$\nSince $\\sigma$ fixes $k$, we use the properties of field homomorphisms to obtain\n\n\\begin{align}\nP(\\sigma(\\alpha)) =\u0026 a_0+a_1\\sigma(\\alpha)+\\cdots+a_n\\sigma(\\alpha)^n \\\\\n=\u0026 \\sigma(a_0 + a_1\\alpha+\\cdots a_n\\alpha^n) \\\\\n=\u0026 \\sigma(0)=0.\n\\end{align}\n\n\n#### 2\n$k_P=k[T]/(P)$ so that an extension exists is obvious, and that it fixes $k$ follows by the definition of a field homomorphism. Then in particular $\\tilde{\\sigma}(P(T))=0=P(\\tilde{\\sigma}(T))$. We can move the $P$ to the outside since the ring homomorphism fixes $k$. \n\nThe second point is the observation that since a homomorphism of field extensions has a unique extension $\\tilde{\\sigma}$ such that $P(\\tilde{\\sigma}(T))=0$, it must be the case that the homomorphism of field extensions sends $T$ to a root of $P(T)$ in $L$.\n\n#### 3\nBy definition, $\\sigma$ determines a field extension $L/M$. By (General, Property 2), $K=M(\\alpha)=M_{P_\\alpha}$. This is an extension over $M$. We want a homomorphism $M_{P_\\alpha}/M\\to L/M$. But $L$ is algebraically closed, so it has nontrivial roots of $P_\\alpha$. Then by (Property 2.2) above, there exists such a field extension homomorphism, i.e. $\\sum_{M(\\alpha)/M}^{L/k}$ is nonempty. This clearly descends to an element in $\\sum_{K/k}^{L/k}$. \n\n## Of dimensions\n1. Suppose $K/k$ and $L/K$ are finite extensions. Then $$[L:K][K:k]=[L:k].$$\n\n## Of algebraic closures\n1. Algebraic closures always exist, and they are unique up to isomorphism\n	1. For all fields $k$ there exists a field extension $\\bar{k}/k$ such that $\\bar{k}$ is algebraic over $k$ and $\\bar{k}$ is algebraically closed.\n\n### Proofs\n#### 1\n_Step 1_\n\nWe will construct an algebraic extension $K_1/k$ such that any nonconstant polynomial with coefficients in $k$ has a root in $K_1$.\n\n_Step 2_\n\n\n\n\n# Examples\n1.

The define $k(\\alpha)$ to be the minimal subfield containing both $k$ and $\\alpha$. \n\nTo see what this means explicitly, observe that $k(\\alpha)$ needs to be closed under addition and multiplication, as well as have inverses. These properties already hold for $k$, so it suffices to impose them for $\\alpha$. Closure under addition and multiplication is equivalently saying for any $P\\in k[T]$, we have $P(\\alpha)\\in k(\\alpha)$. To also have multiplicative inverses, we need to also be able to divide by polynomials which are not zero on $\\alpha$. Thus every element $a\\in k(\\alpha)$ can be represented as $a=\\frac{P(\\alpha)}{Q(\\alpha)}$, where $Q(\\alpha)\\neq 0$. \n\n## $k(\\alpha_1,\\dots,\\alpha_n)$\nSimilar to the above, this is the minimal subfield of $K$ containing $k$ and the $\\{a_i\\}$.

By the [Fundamental thm of Galois Theory](notes/ntpy/Theorems/Field Theory/Fundamental thm of Galois Theory.md), the subfield of $\\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$ corresponding to $A$ is the one which is fixed under $A$. Suppose $|A|=m$. Then the elements of $A$ correspond to applying the Frobenius map up to $m$ times. The unique field (hence the subfield in question) that is fixed under such maps is $\\mathbb{F}_{p^m}$.

This is sometimes called an inner automorphism. Because of this, there is an analogy with the [funamental groupoid](): \n- For a topological space, assign to each point the fundamental group at that point. Morphisms are paths between points (which are invertible)\n- For a field, assign to each separable closure its absolute Galois group. Morphisms are multipilication by a conjugate, between objects that become equal after the application of the map.\n\n# Properties\n1. Let $K/F$ be a finite separable extension in $F^s/F$. Then $G_F$ acts on $\\text{Et}(K,F^s)$ (see [etale algebras](notes/ntpy/etale algebras.md)) by \\begin{gather} \\sigma i\\mapsto \\sigma \\circ i \\\\ (K\\overset{i}{\\rightarrow} F)\\mapsto (K\\overset{i}{\\rightarrow}F^s\\overset{\\sigma}{\\rightarrow}F^s,\\end{gather} and the kernel of this action is $\\text{Gal}(F^s/N)$, where $N$ is the compositum of all conjugates of $K$, i.e. all images of the embeddings $i$.\n2. The action in (1) extends to a transitive action of $\\text{Gal}(N/F)$ on $\\text{Et}(K,F^s)$. \n	1. This process of reduction is like reducing the entire absolute galois group to the galois group of $K/F$, for example:\n	2. Consider $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[3]{2},\\omega)/\\mathbb{Q})$. The kernel of the action of $G_\\mathbb{Q}$ are those elements that fix the three cube roots of $2$, which is definitionally $\\text{Gal}(\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[3]{2},\\omega))$. So the action of $G_\\mathbb{Q}$ reduces to an action of $G_\\mathbb{Q}/\\text{Gal}(\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}/\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[3]{2},\\omega))=\\text{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt[3]{2},\\omega)/\\mathbb{Q})$. \n\n*Proofs*\n**1**\nWe first make a remark on the last part of the property\'s statement, to verify that the image of $K$ under any $i$ is a conjugate of $K$. Any embedding permutes the roots of the minimal polynomial of $K$, and this is what we mean by a "conjugate" of $K$.\n\nWe now wish to verify the kernel of the action is $\\text{Gal}(F^s/N)$. Let $\\sigma\\in\\text{Gal}(F^s/N)$. By construction $N$ contains all conjugates of $K$, hence $\\sigma$ fixes all embeddings of $K$ in $F^s$. So $\\sigma$ is in the kernel. Any element in the kernel likewise fixes any conjugate of $K$, hence is an element of $\\text{Gal}(F^s/N)$.\n\n**2**\nThe action extends in such a way as to remove the kernel: by $(G_F=\\text{Gal}(F^s/F))/\\text{Gal}(F^s/N)=\\text{Gal}(N/F)$. Why is $N$ normal? $F^s$ has all roots of the minimal polynomial of $K/F$ (since it is a separable polynomial so all its roots are separable hence in $F^s$), hence $N$ is the splitting field of that polynomial.\n\nIt is transitive because $\\text{Gal}(N/F)$ is Galois and $\\text{Et}(K,F^s)$ corresponds to different permutations of the roots of the minimal polynomial, on which $\\text{Gal}(N/F)$ acts transitively.\n\nTo see this another way, let $i_0:K\\to F^s$ be an embedding. The stabilizer of $i_0$, under the action of $\\text{Gal}(N/F)$ described above, is $\\text{Gal}(N/K)\\subset\\text{Gal}(N/F)$, as the elements that fix (an embedding of) $K\\subset F^s$ are definitionally those of $\\text{Gal}(N/i_0K)\\cong\\text{Gal}(N/K)$. By the [orbit-stabilizer theorem](), the orbit of $i_0$ has size $$|\\text{Gal}(N/F)|/|\\text{Gal}(N/K)|=[N:F]/[N:K]=[K:F],$$ which implies the action is transitive as the only way the orbit could have that many elements is if it had every conjugate in it.',lastmodified:"2022-01-27T04:08:13.216681499Z",title:"absolute galois group"},"/notes/ntpy/Definitions/Algebraic-Number-Theory/Field-Theory/infinite-galois-extensions":{content:"# Properties\n1. $G$ is always uncountable.\n2. $G$ is compact Hausdorff (hence a [profinite group](notes/ntpy/profinite group.md) under the [Krull topology](notes/ntpy/Definitions/Algebraic Number Theory/Field Theory/Krull topology.md).",lastmodified:"2022-01-27T04:08:13.216681499Z",title:"infinite galois extensions"},"/notes/ntpy/Definitions/Algebraic-Number-Theory/Field-Theory/separable-closure":{content:'# Idea\nThe separable closure of $F$, denoted $F^\\text{sep}$, is the "biggest Galois extension of $F$".

But this means that $v_p(x-y)$ gets bigger and bigger.

By part (5), we can write $xy=p^mu_1p^nu_2$. Suppose $xy=0$. Since the $u_i$ are invertible, this would mean $p^{m+n}=0$, which is impossible.\n##### 3\nSuppose $px=0$. We need to show that $x=0$. To that end, consider that $px=0$ implies $px_{n+1}\\equiv 0\\mod p^{n+1}$ for all $n$. Then $px_{n+1}=p^{n+1}y_{n+1}$ for some $y_{n+1}\\in \\mathbb{Z}/(p^{n+1})$. Dividing both sides by $p$, we can write $x=p^ny_{n+1}$. Under the natural homomorphism $\\phi_{n+1}:\\mathbb{Z}/(p^{n+1})\\to\\mathbb{Z}/(p^n)$, clearly $\\phi(x)=0$ since it has $p^n$ as a factor. Thus $x_n$ is zero (for all $n$).\n\nThe corresponding claim for multiplication by $p^n$ follows because it is the $n$-fold composition of maps that are multiplication by $p$, which are injective.\n##### 4\nBy (3), multiplication by $p^i$ is an isomorphism. Clearly $\\epsilon_i$ is surjective. So it suffices to show that $\\ker\\epsilon_i=p^n\\mathbb{Z}_p$.\n\nClearly $p^i\\mathbb{Z}_p\\subset\\text{ker}\\epsilon_i$ since the $i$th coordinate is multiplied by $p^i$ so it vanishes. Conversely, let $x\\in\\ker\\epsilon_i$. Since the $i$th coordinate vanishes, all lower order coordinates vanish as well. So just define $y\\in\\mathbb{Z}_p$ to be the renumbering of the coordinates of $x$ starting with $x_{i+1}=y_1$. Then clearly $x=p^i\\cdot y$.\n##### 5\nThe only nontrivial thing is to show that 3 implies 1. Suppose $p\\nmid x$.  To show that $x$ is invertible, it suffices to show that each component is invertible. Consider $x_m$. Its image in $\\mathbb{Z}/(p)$ is invertible hence there exists $y,z\\in\\mathbb{Z}/(p^m)$ such that $xy+pz=1$. We claim then that $x_m$ is invertible in $\\mathbb{Z}/(p^m)$:\n\n\\begin{align}\nx(y+ypz+\\cdots+yp^{n-1}z^{n-1}) =\u0026 xy(1+pz+\\cdots+p^{n-1}z^{n-1}) \\\\\n=\u0026 (1-pz)(1+pz+\\cdots+p^{n-1}z^{n-1}) \\\\\n=\u0026 1.\n\\end{align}\n\n##### 6\nSimilar to our discussion in (4). If $x\\in\\mathbb{Z}_p$ is nonzero, then there exists a largest integer $n$ such that $x_n=0$. Take $u$ to be the renumbering of $x$ starting with $u_1=x_{n+1}$. All its components are nonzero hence $u$ is invertible.\n##### 7\nWe need to show that every $x\\in\\mathbb{Z}_p$ is the limit of a sequence $(y_n)$ where $y_n\\in\\mathbb{Z}$. Just take $y_n\\equiv x_n\\mod p^n$.\n\n### Of p-adics\n\n### Of units\n1. $\\epsilon_n\\mid_U:U\\to(\\mathbb{Z}/(p^n))^\\ast$ is a surjective group homomorphism with kernel $U_n$.\n	1. $U/U_1\\cong\\mathbb{F}_p^\\ast$, hence is cyclic of order $p-1$.\n2.  By property (5) of integer p-adics, $\\mathbb{Q}_p^\\ast=p^\\mathbb{Z}\\times U$ where $U$ is the set of units. \n	1. Let $U_n=1+p^n\\mathbb{Z}_p\\subset U$. Then $U_n$ is a subgroup and $$\\epsilon_n\\mid_U:U\\to(\\mathbb{Z}/(p^n))^\\ast$$ from property (3) of integer p-adics is a surjective group homomorphism, and its kernel is $U_n$.\n3. (Teichmuller decomposition) $U=T\\times U_1$, where $T=\\{x\\in U\\mid x^{p-1}=1\\}$ is a cyclic group of $p-1$ elements.\n#### Proofs\n##### 1\nThe unrestricted $\\epsilon_n$ is already shown to be a surjective ring homomorphism by (4) of integer p-adics. So in particular it sends invertible elements in $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ (and therefore invertible elements in $U$) to invertible elements in $(\\mathbb{Z}/(p^n))^\\ast$. It remains to show the other direction, that if $\\epsilon_n(x)$ for $x\\in\\mathbb{Z}_p$ then $x$ is invertible, hence $x\\in U$. An element in $(\\mathbb{Z}/(p^n))^\\ast$ is invertible if and only if it is relatively prime to $p^n$. So $x$ is invertible if and only if $p\\nmid\\epsilon_n(x)$. By part (5) of integer p-adics, this shows that $x$ is invertible.\n\n$U_1$ is the kernel of $\\epsilon_1:U\\to(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^\\ast$. Since $\\epsilon_1$ is clearly surjective, $U/U_1\\cong(\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z})^\\ast\\cong\\mathbb{F}_p^\\ast$.\n\n### Product formula\n**Theorem.** Consider the special set of absolute values on $\\mathbb{Q}$\n- $\\|\\cdot\\|_\\infty=|\\cdot|$\n- $\\|\\cdot\\|_p=p^{-v_p(\\cdot)}$.\nSuppose $x\\in\\mathbb{Q}$.

Consider the map $\\mathbb{A}^1\\setminus\\{1\\}\\to\\mathbb{A}^1$ defined by $z\\mapsto z^2$. Then every point in the image has finite fiber: the points $0,1$ have fibers of cardinality 1 and every other point has a fiber of cardinality 2. \n\nWe calculate the coordinate ring for $\\mathbb{A}^1\\setminus \\{1\\}$. This is isomorphic to $\\{(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{A}^2\\mid xy-y=1\\}\\subset\\mathbb{A}^2$ by the maps $x\\mapsto (x,\\frac{1}{x-1})$ and $(x,y)\\mapsto x$. Thus the coordinate ring can be seen to be isomorphic to $k[x,y]/(xy-y-1)$. \n\nThe coordinate ring of $\\mathbb{A}^1$ is $k[x]$, so the induced map on coordinate rings is $k[x]\\hookrightarrow k[x,y]/(xy-y-1)$. But $k[x,y](xy-y-1)$ is not finitely generated as a $k[x]$-algebra, which can be seen by observing that the elements $y,y^2,y^3,\\dots$ remain linearly independent. \n\n*3*\nLet $f:X\\to Y$ and $g:Y\\to Z$ be finite morphisms. To show that $g\\circ f$ (notation $gf$) is finite, we need to show that $K[X]$ is finitely generated as a $(gf)^\\ast(K[Z])$-module. By assumption, $K[X]$ is finitely generated as an $f^\\ast(K[Y])$-module and $K[Y]$ is finitely generated as a $g^\\ast(K[Z])$-module.\n\nLet $y\\in K[Y]$. Then it can be written as a finite linear combination $y=g^\\ast(z_1)y_1+\\cdots+g^\\ast(z_n)y_n$ with coefficients in $g^\\ast(K[Z])\\subset K[Y]$. Since every element in $K[X]$ can be expressed as a finite linear combination with coefficients in $f^\\ast(K[Y])$, it suffices to show that $f^\\ast(y)$ can be expressed as a finite linear combination with coefficients in $(gf)^\\ast(K[Z])$. \n\nTo that end, observe that $f^\\ast$ is an algebra homomorphism, hence $f^\\ast(y)=f^\\ast(g^\\ast(z_1)y_1+\\cdots g^\\ast(z_n)y_n)=(gf)^\\ast(z_1)f^\\ast(y_1)+\\cdots+(gf)^\\ast(z_n)f^\\ast(y_n)$.This expresses $f^\\ast(y)$ as a finite linear combination as desired.

(As in homotopy type theory, the path itself carries information: there may be two witnesses (=paths) to the isomorphisms that belong to different homotopy classes.)\n\nThe path is indespensible, as the following example will illustrate. Let $X=\\{y\\}$, and let $f$ be the inclusion. What is the fiber of $f$ "up to isomorphism"? As a set, the fiber is only a single point: $\\{y\\}$. Certainly this is in the fiber as there is the trivial path connecting $y$ to itself. However, there may be other paths from $y$ to itself that are not homotopic to the trivial path, in which case we ought to regard those witnesses as distinct elements from the trivial one. So we can model elements in the _homotopy fiber_ as a pair $(x,p)$ where $x$ is a point and $p:f(x)\\to y$ is a path. So the homotopy fiber of $f$ here is the set of $(y,p)$ where $p$ is a representative of a homotopy class of paths from $y$ to itself. This is precisely the data of a loop space, so in this case $\\text{hofib}(f)=\\Omega Y$ (at $y$).\n\n# Definition\nAs stated above, the homotopy fiber of $f:X\\to Y$ at $y\\in Y$ is the set of $x\\in X$ equipped with paths from $f(x)\\to y$ modulo homotopy.

This is because working with the entire category has \"too much\" information since we only want to consider things up to homotopy. For instance, if two topological spaces are homotopy equivalent, we wish to consider them as isomorphic when passing to the new setting.\n\nThis leads us to our first idea, the homotopy category. This is obtained by taking the same objects and morphisms and adding inverses for all homotopy equivalences, thereby making them isomorphisms. Unfortunately, [Ho(C) is badly behaved](notes/ntpy/Key Ideas/Homotopy theory/Ho(C) is badly behaved.md). It does not preserve limits, for example. In short, the categorical constructions in the homotopy category don't tell us anything about categorical constructions in the original category, not even up to homotopy.\n\nIf the category in question admits the structure of a model category, however, we have an alternative. Namely, we take an object, pass to its [(co)fibrant resolution](notes/ntpy/Definitions/Homotopy theory/(co)fibrant resolution.md), and then take the limit. Taking limits of these special classes of objects does respect homotopy equivalence.\n\nA few issues present themselves:\n- We still have a lot of data that isn't stricly related to homotopy\n- It might be necessary to work with different model structures to compute limits vs. colimits.\n	- For example, in homological algebra, there are two model structures: projective and injective. These have cofibrant and fibrant replacements, respectively, which correspond to projective and injective resolutions (respectively). However, we discuss [here](notes/ntpy/Definitions/Homological algebra/inj proj resolutions.md) that projective resolutions model homotopy limits while injective resolutions model colimits.

You could say this is precisely the defining property of the Cartesian product of sets. From this we can derive what functions of the form $f:A\\times B\\to C$ look like. For example, we can deduce that because elements of $A\\times B$ are by definition those of the form $(a,b)$, to define $f$ it suffices to define $f$ on pairs $(a,b)$.\n\nIn type theory, we do the opposite, that is declare that to define $f$ it suffices to define $f$ on pairs $(a,b)$, and then we can deduce that every element in $A\\times B$ is equal to a pair $(a,b)$. Let\'s break that down in more detail.\n\nType theory takes a different approach. In sort of a Haskellian view of functions as "first-class citizens", it says that what really matters about the Cartesian product is how functions (out of it) are defined. Why should that matter as opposed to how elements are defined? Well the Cartesian product serves a very special purpose. It is the *left adjoint* of exponentiation, by which we mean the creation of functions.\n\nWhat does this mean, specifically? Recall that while we could have defined functions of multiple variables, this wasn\'t necessary. By [currying](notes/ntpy/Definitions/Logic/Type theory/Currying.md), a function that takes inputs from $A$ and $B$ to yield an element in $C$ can be thought of as a function $A\\to (B\\to C)$.\n\nDid you catch that? We just said something that isn\'t well defined. We implied that "a function that takes inputs from $A$ and $B$ to yield an element in $C$" was a well-defined statement, but it isn\'t yet. The curried function $A\\to B\\to C$ by definition takes an input from $A$ and yields an element/function in $(B\\to C)$; it doesn\'t take one element from $A$ and one element from $B$ and return an element in $C$.\n\nThe Cartesian product type serves to make the statement "a function that takes inputs from $A$ and $B$ to yield an element in $C$" well-defined. Indeed, this statement pretty much tells us how to define the Cartesian product. Given elements $a:A$ and $b:B$ define an element $(a,b):A\\times B$. Now keeping in mind that we want functions $A\\times B\\to C$ to be equivalent to their curried counterpart $A\\to B\\to C$, we say that given $g:A\\to B\\to C$, define $f:A\\times B\\to C$ by $f((a,b))=g(a)(b)$. \n\nWe just said something that again has a subtle implication. We implied that to define $f:A\\times B\\to C$, it sufficed to define its value on pairs $(a,b)$. To be clear, this is an actual constraint we are imposing in our definition; it is not a derivable fact. Indeed, if we did not make this constraint, there is no reason to believe that it suffices to define $f$ only on pairs $(a,b)$, for we did not declare (unlike in Set Theory!) that every element in $A\\times B$ was of the form $(a,b)$. \n\nSo just to recap, while in Set Theory we defined the Cartesian product as the set of elements of the form $(a,b)$, in type theory we are defining functions, in particular that to define a function $A\\times B\\to C$ it suffices to define it on pairs $(a,b):A\\times B$. This statement is the _recursion principle for products_ in type theory.\n\nFrom this recursion principle we can prove the _uniqueness principle_, which is subtle in its own right. This is the proposition (emphasis on proposition) that every element in $A\\times B$ is _equal_ to a pair $(a,b)$. Why is this so subtle? Well this is due to how the identity type is defined in type theory. So lets say that we are asserting $x:A\\times B$ is equal to the pair $(a,b)$. In type theory this means that the type $x=_{A\\times B}(a,b)$ is inhabited, meaning there is an element $p:x=_{A\\times B}(a,b)$.\n\nAt this point, it is actually beneficial to think of homotopy type theory. In homotopy type theory types are spaces up to homotopy, and elements of a type are points on that space. Equality is the type whose elements are paths on that space. All of this is to set up what I think is a really intuitive idea: two elements of a type are equal when there is a path connecting them. Now it is immediate to see the subtlety I was alluding to before. Just because $x$ and $(a,b)$ are equal, it doesn\'t mean they are the same element, just that there exists a path connecting them!\n\nAnd yes, when we are taking about sets the type theoretic and set theoretic definitions are equivalent. Spelled out, if we were to regard a set as a space then it is a totally disconnected one: the only paths are the constant ones from an element to itself, so equality in the sense of type theory collapses to the idea that two elements are equal if and only if they are definitionally the same.\n\nThe advantage of the type theoretic definition is that it generalizes the set theoretic one. I\'ve been studying homotopy theory on my own for a bit now, and had always heard that we only care about things "up to homotopy". Even in general we rarely care about things up to strict equality, it is far more useful to consider things that are equal "up to something", whether that be isomorphism, homeomorphism, or homotopy. For some reason it was only through unpacking the product type that I understood how ideas from homotopy theory played into logic. As we just saw, we have the ability to specify how strong a notion of equality we want to work with.\n\nHere is the familiar adjunction we were working hard to define: $$\\text{hom}(A\\times B,C)=\\text{hom}(A,\\text{hom}(B,C)).$$ The above discussion could essentially be described as saying, the definition of the product type is defined in such a way as to be the left adjoint to exponentiation.\n\n# Definition\nGiven types $A$ and $B$, we define the type $A\\times B$:\n- *Formation*: $A$ is a type and $B$ is a type\n- *Construction*: given $a:A$ and $b:B$ we may form $(a,b):A\\times B$.\n- *Eliminator*: for any $g:A\\to B\\to C$, define $f:A\\times B\\to C$ by $$f((a,b)):\\equiv g(a)(b).$$ In other words the recursor for product types is \\begin{gather}\\text{rec}_{A\\times B}:\\prod_{C\\in\\mathcal{U}}(A\\to B\\to C)\\to (A\\times B\\to C) \\\\ \\text{rec}_{A\\times B}(C,g,(a,b)):\\equiv g(a)(b).\\end{gather}',lastmodified:"2022-01-27T04:08:13.220681502Z",title:"Product type"},"/notes/ntpy/Definitions/Logic/Type-theory/Universes":{content:'# Definition\n**Definition.** A *universe* is a type whose elements are types.\n\n**Definition.** The types in a particular universe are called *small types*.\n\n# Typical ambiguity\nWe may wish to regard a universe as containing itself.

The functor category is called the _category of linear representations of $G$ over $F$_.\n\n- At first it may not be clear how this lines up with the traditional definition, in which a representation is a map from $G$ to the automorphism group of $V$ (as opposed to just $V$). A functor between categories covariantly induces a group homomorphism between the automorphism groups (see [Automorphisms of a category](notes/ntpy/Definitions/Category theory/Automorphisms of a category.md)). So a functor contains exactly the information of the traditional definition.\n- Morphisms of representations are natural transformations in the corresponding category of linear representations. By definition, if $S$ and $T$ are representations, then a morphism $\\phi:S\\to T$ is a commuting diagram of the form $$\\begin{array} sG \u0026 \\overset{S}{\\rightarrow} \u0026 \\text{Vect}_F \\\\ \\downarrow \u0026 \u0026 \\downarrow \\\\ G \u0026 \\overset{T}{\\rightarrow} \u0026 \\text{Vect}_F \\end{array}.$$ The map on the left is the identity. Also, every representation defined as a functor is in bijection with a group homomorphism from $G$ to the automorphism group of the vector space $V$ it is acting on, which are (invertible) maps $V\\overset{g}{\\to}V$. So diagrams of the form above are in bijection with commuting diagrams of the form $$\\begin{array} sV \u0026 \\overset{\\phi}{\\rightarrow} \u0026 W \\\\ \\llap{g}{\\downarrow} \u0026 \u0026 \\llap{g}{\\downarrow} \\\\ V \u0026 \\overset{\\phi}{\\rightarrow} \u0026 W \\end{array}$$ for all $g\\in G$, which matches the traditional definition.\n\n**Definition.** A *faithful representation* is a [faithful functor](notes/ntpy/Definitions/Category theory/Full, faithful functors.md) in the category of representations.\n\n- We should check that this matches with the notion of a faithful representation in the traditional definition. Let $T$ be a representation, in the sense that it is a functor. In particular $T$ can be regarded as a morphism of groups by our remarks above. Suppose the kernel of $T$ (regarded as a morphism of groups) is just the identity on $G$. Now suppose $T(g)=T(h)$. Then $T(g)T(g^{-1})=T(h)T(g^{-1})$ so $T(hg^{-1})=1$ so $h=g$. Conversely, suppose $T$ is a faithful functor. If $T(g)=1$, then by definition of a faithful functor $g$ must be the identity morphism on $G$, which is precisely the identity group element.\n\n### Irreducible representations\nWe claim that the traditional definition of irreducible representations coincides with that of [simple objects](notes/ntpy/Definitions/Category theory/Simple objects.md) in the category of representations.\n\nOne direction is clear. If a representation $T$ is reducible, then there is an [epimorphism](notes/ntpy/Definitions/Category theory/Mono, epimorphisms.md) from it to one of its nontrivial subrepresentations. It remains to show that a simple object is an irreducible representation. Let $S$ be a simple object, say acting on a vector space $V$. Then its only [quotient objects](notes/ntpy/Definitions/Category theory/Subobjects, quotient objects.md) are itself and 0. This means that there are no nontrivial subspaces $U\\subset V$ such that $S'=S\\mid_U$ is a representation, for then $S\\to S'$ would be an epimorphism. Hence $S$ is irreducible.\n\n### Dual\nThe [dual object](notes/ntpy/Definitions/Category theory/Dual object.md) in the category is the internal hom from the object to the [unit object](notes/ntpy/Definitions/Category theory/Unit object.md). We claim that the traditional definition of the dual representation is equivalent to taking the dual object of a representation when viewed as an object in the category of representations. \n\nBy the definition of a dual object that we have just given, we need to check $[T,I]$ where $T$ is an arbitrary representation and $I$ is the unit (below we spell out that this is the trivial representation on the base field $K$). By the above discussion, the set of morphisms $[T,I]$ is in bijection with squares of the form \n$$\n\\begin{array}\nzV \u0026 \\rightarrow \u0026 K \\\\\n\\llap{{}^g}{\\downarrow} \u0026 \u0026 \\llap{{}^{1_K}}{\\downarrow} \\\\\nV \u0026 \\rightarrow \u0026 K\n\\end{array}\n$$\nfor all $g\\in G$. These are equivalent to $\\text{Hom}(V\\overset{g}{\\to}V,K)$. By contravariance this is equivalently a map $\\text{Hom}(V,K)\\to\\text{Hom}(V,K)$ defined by sending $f\\mapsto g^{-1}f$. (The map defined by $g$ lives in the opposite category of $G$ hence we need to invert it). \n\nSo we can see that for $T^\\ast(g)$ it must be the case that $f(gv)=f(g^{-1}(v))$. We can then write this as in the traditional definition: $T^\\ast(g)=(T(g^{-1}))^\\ast$.\n\n### Properties\n- Monoidal category\n	- The tensor product of linear representations makes the category of linear representations a monoidal category.\n	- The unit is the trivial representation on the base field (see below)\n	- Generally, this is true if the target category is monoidal, for example $\\text{Vect}_F$ is monoidal.\n\n# Reducibility and Decomposability\nA representation is *decomposable* if it can be written as the direct sum of nontrivial subrepresentations. This might seem like the same thing as a reducable representation, but it is not.\n\nWhile every irreducible representation is indecomposable, not every indecomposable representation is irreducible. This is the intuition that a representation may only have a single non-trivial representation. \n\nHowever, if $G$ is finite and $\\text{char}(k)\\nmid |G|$, then the two notions coincide. In particular, every indecomposable representation is irreducible.

Let $G$ and $H$ be Lie groups, and $G$ is additionally connected. Then a map $\\rho:G\\to H$ is uniquely determined by its differential at the identity: $d\\rho_e:T_eG\\to T_eH$.\n2. Let $G$ and $H$ be Lie groups, with $G$ connected and simply connected. Then a linear map $T_eG\\to T_eH$ is the differential of a homomorphism $\\rho:G\\to H$ if and only if it preserves the bracket operation.\n\nThe first statement already looks strong, but a priori we do not know whether an arbitrary map between Lie algebras is the differential of a map between Lie groups. The second principle answers this question.\n\n## Bracket\nGiven our two principles above, we might formulate the following question:\n\n- How is the structure of a homomorphism of Lie groups reflected in its differential, which is a map of Lie algebras?\n\nGiven a map of Lie groups there is a canonical induced map of Lie algebras— constructing this is not the problem. The problem is seeing what structure within the Lie algebra is preserved under this induced map.\n\nTo do this, we can regard "structure" as an endomorphism. Then, we can somehow associate to the structure maps on $G$ some structure maps on $T_eG$ and see what $d\\rho$ does to them.\n\nFor example, for any element $g\\in G$ there is an endomorphism $m_g:G\\to G$ which is just multiplication by $g$. Then, to say that a homomorphism $\\rho:G\\to H$ preserves a certain structure is to say that it commutes with the structure endomorphism. For instance, a homomorphism $\\rho:G\\to H$ is a smooth map that respects the group structure in the sense that $\\rho(gh)=\\rho(g)\\rho(h)$, and we may equivalently formulate this property in terms of the structure map $m_g$ above:\n\n\u003cimg align="center" src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/%5Cbegin%7Btikzcd%7D%0A%09G%20%26%20H%20%5C%5C%0A%09G%20%26%20H%0A%09%5Carrow%5B%22%7Bm_g%7D%22\'%2C%20from%3D1-1%2C%20to%3D2-1%5D%0A%09%5Carrow%5B%22%5Crho%22\'%2C%20from%3D2-1%2C%20to%3D2-2%5D%0A%09%5Carrow%5B%22%5Crho%22%2C%20from%3D1-1%2C%20to%3D1-2%5D%0A%09%5Carrow%5B%22%7Bm_%7B%5Crho(g)%7D%7D%22%2C%20from%3D1-2%2C%20to%3D2-2%5D%0A%5Cend%7Btikzcd%7D" alt="\\begin{tikzcd}\n	G \u0026amp; H \\\\\n	G \u0026amp; H\n	\\arrow\u0026quot;{m_g}\u0026quot;\', from=1-1, to=2-1]\n	\\arrow\u0026quot;\\rho\u0026quot;\', from=2-1, to=2-2]\n	\\arrow\u0026quot;\\rho\u0026quot;, from=1-1, to=1-2]\n	\\arrow\u0026quot;{m_{\\rho(g)}}\u0026quot;, from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}" /\u003e\n\n(start with $h$ in the top left, and commutativity relations give the formula above). If this diagram commutes for all $g$ then we have a homomorphism, so we can think of $\\rho$ as being a homomorphism iff it preserves the structure maps $\\{m_g\\}_{g\\in G}$.\n\nWe could try to "lift" these structure maps to $T_e G$ and see if $d\\rho$ preserves them, but this doesn\'t work well because $m_g$ does not fix $e$, so we can\'t expect to be able to associate a map corresponding to $m_g$ on the tangent space at $e$.\n\nSo our next goal is to build another endomorphism, $\\Psi_g$, that does fix $e$ but also expresses the group structure like $\\{m_g\\}$ did, i.e. such that $\\rho$ is a homomorphism iff it preserves the structure maps $\\{\\Psi_g\\}_{g\\in G}$. We suggest the map of conjugation: $$\\Psi_g(h)=ghg^{-1}.$$\nA map is a group homomorphism implies that it preserves conjugation for all elements, so $\\rho$ is a homomorphism implies $\\{\\Psi_g\\}_{g\\in G}$ is preserved. It also has the added benefit that $\\Psi_g(e)=e$ for all $g$, so at least $e$ is fixed so we can try to associate to $\\Psi_g$ a map $T_eG\\to T_eG$.  So if $\\rho$ is a homomorphism, then the following diagram commutes: \n\n\u003cimg align="center" src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/%5Cbegin%7Btikzcd%7D%0A%09G%20%26%20H%20%5C%5C%0A%09G%20%26%20H%0A%09%5Carrow%5B%22%7B%5CPsi_g%7D%22\'%2C%20from%3D1-1%2C%20to%3D2-1%5D%0A%09%5Carrow%5B%22%5Crho%22\'%2C%20from%3D2-1%2C%20to%3D2-2%5D%0A%09%5Carrow%5B%22%5Crho%22%2C%20from%3D1-1%2C%20to%3D1-2%5D%0A%09%5Carrow%5B%22%7B%5CPsi_%7B%5Crho(g)%7D%7D%22%2C%20from%3D1-2%2C%20to%3D2-2%5D%0A%5Cend%7Btikzcd%7D" alt="\\begin{tikzcd}\n	G \u0026amp; H \\\\\n	G \u0026amp; H\n	\\arrow\u0026quot;{\\Psi_g}\u0026quot;\', from=1-1, to=2-1]\n	\\arrow\u0026quot;\\rho\u0026quot;\', from=2-1, to=2-2]\n	\\arrow\u0026quot;\\rho\u0026quot;, from=1-1, to=1-2]\n	\\arrow\u0026quot;{\\Psi_{\\rho(g)}}\u0026quot;, from=1-2, to=2-2]\n\\end{tikzcd}" /\u003e\n\nWhat\'s more, conjugation is an automorphism, so there is an associated map $$\\Psi:G\\to \\text{Aut}(G).$$ At this point, we recall the following fact: $T_e\\text{Aut}(T_eG)\\cong\\text{End}(T_eG)$. So we want to lift $\\Psi$ to $T_eG$, but we cant just take the differential, as then we would have a map $T_eG\\to T_e\\text{Aut}(G)$. Our fact above suggests that we first want to lift $\\text{Aut}(G)$ to $\\text{Aut}(T_eG)$. We can do this just be taking the differential of the maps in $\\text{Aut}(G)$, which amounts to associating a map \\begin{gather} \\text{Ad}:G\\to \\text{Aut}(T_eG) \\\\ g\\mapsto (d\\Psi_g)_e\\end{gather} which is actually a representation since $T_eG$ can be regarded as a vector space.

Then $x^{n+1}=x^nx$ can be expressed by multiplying the linear combination for $x^n$ above by $x$, then substituting in that expression if an $x^n$ term appears after multiplying by $x$. Thus we can express $x^{n+k}$ for $k\\geq 0$ in terms of $1,x,\\dots,x^{n-1}$.  A natural basis for $A[x]$ is $1,x,x^2,\\dots$, but we have just shown that we can take the finite basis $1,x,\\dots,x^{n-1}$.

The field of fractions contains all other localizations\n	- This is is due to the contravariant relationship between inclusions of prime ideals and inclusions of localizations: if $p\\supset p_1$ then $R_p\\subset R_{p_1}$.\n2. The localization of a commutative ring at a prime ideal is a [local ring](notes/ntpy/Definitions/Ring theory/Local ring.md).\n3. Localization is functorial\n4. Localization is an [exact functor](notes/ntpy/Definitions/Category theory/Exact functor.md), in the sense that it preserves exact sequences.\n5.

Since $g\\circ f=0$ and localization is functorial, we have $S^{-1}(g)\\circ S^{-1}(f) = S^{-1}(g\\circ f)=0$. This shows that $\\text{im}(f)\\subseteq\\text{ker}(g)$. Conversely, suppose $\\frac{m}{s}\\in \\text{ker}(S^{-1}g)$. Then $S^{-1}g(\\frac{m}{s}) = \\frac{g(m)}{s}=0$. By definition this means there exists $s'\\in S$ such that $$s'(g(m)-0) = s'g(m)=g(s'm)=0.$$ (The last equality is because $g$ is an $A$-module homomorphism.) Since by assumption $\\text{ker}g=\\text{im}f$, there exists $m_1\\in M_1$ such that $f(m_1)=s'm$. So $$\\frac{m}{s}=\\frac{f(m_1)}{ss'}=S^{-1}f(\\frac{m}{ss'}),$$ which shows that $\\frac{m}{s}\\in\\text{im}S^{-1}f$. Hence $\\text{im}S^{-1}f=\\text{ker}S^{-1}g$, which shows exactness.\n\nThe converse is not true without additional assumptions. For example, what we have just proven is that if the original sequence is exact then the localized sequence is exact for arbitrary $S$. But it could be the case that the localized sequence at one $S$ is exact while the localized sequence at another $S'$ is not exact. Then it cannot be the case that the original sequence was exact.\n#### 5\nLet $\\mathfrak{q}$ be prime ideal in $S^{-1}A$.

Then $S^{-1}A/S^{-1}\\mathfrak{p}\\cong \\bar{S}^{-1}(A/\\mathfrak{p})$. By (1) this is a subring of the field of fractions, hence in particular either 0 or an integral domain. In the latter case, this implies $S^{-1}\\mathfrak{p}$ is a prime ideal in $S^{-1}A$. In the former case, this implies $S^{-1}\\mathfrak{p}=S^{-1}A$. But then (Extended..., Property 1)  implies that $(S^{-1}\\mathfrak{p})^{ce}=S^{-1}A$. This only happens when $s\\in (S^{-1}\\mathfrak{p})^c$ for some $s\\in S$.

By ordinary, we mean a (potentially small) category which is a collection of objects and morphisms adhering to a set of conditions. We have a grasp of what it means to "do category theory" in this setting: functors, limits, adjunctions, etc. \n\nThis is not enough for homotopy theory. In topology, we can have a pair of paths, and be able to continuously deform one path into the other. This is a homotopy, and viewing a path as a morphism we get that a homotopy is just a morphism of morphisms, a 2-morphism.\n\nThe problem is that our ordinary categorical constructions don\'t account for higher morphisms, like the 2-morphisms. They don\'t have defined behavior there, so 1-categorical constructions can\'t directly tell us anything about the higher morphisms.\n\nAt this point, we have two options. The first is to develop category theory for higher categories. This seems like the morally correct approach, but it is quite difficult, and an area of active research. The specialization to the special case of $(\\infty,1)$-categories is the subject of "infinity category theory".\n\nThe second approach is far easier, and therefore worth considering: somehow compress the higher category into a 1-category, and then do our normal categorical constructions. The hope is that this will tell us something about the higher category. Naturally, we lose information when we do this, but the hope is that we preserve just enough to say something about the higher category.\n\nThe difficult part is deciding how to compress a higher category into a 1-category.\n\n# Approach 1: forget higher structure\nWell the first idea one might suggest is to simply "forget" the higher structure. This means, entirely ignore all morphisms higher than 1. In the category of topological spaces, this looks like forgetting all homotopies, for example. If we do this, we are left with a 1-category and then we can do our usual constructions. To summarize this approach, we are simply regarding the higher category as a 1-category and ignoring all higher structure.\n\nThere is nothing wrong here, except that it does little for the homotopy theorist! Indeed, by forgetting higher structure we have forgotten that two paths are homotopic: we have forgotten homotopies, the very thing we were trying to study!\n\n# Approach 2: homotopy category\nThe second approach is to form the homotopy category. The idea is the following: when we just forgot the higher structure, we completely destroyed any relationship that two homotopic morphisms had to each other. Instead, we could simply forget *how* they are related. By this we mean we just treat homotopic maps as isomorphic, i.e. identify homotopic maps. This immediately makes all higher morphisms trivial, and we again obtain a 1-category. As opposed to the first method, this preserves a little more information. \n\nThere is, of course, the question of how to construct it, and what properties it preserves of the higher category. Here I want to take a slightly more pedantic and motivated approach via the nerve construction.\n\n# Simplicial sets and higher categories\nThere is a way of conceptualizing higher morphisms using simplicial sets. Let\'s take 2-morphisms. \n\nAs alluded to above, in homotopy theory we are concerned with $(\\infty,1)$-categories. As you might expect, we can model such a category as a special simplicial set. In fact, there are several models, all of which generally agree with each other. We take here the quasi-category model, developed by Joyal and expanded on by Lurie.\n\n# Nerve construction\nThere is a simple way to construct a simplicial set out of a 1-category, and this construction is called the nerve construction. It sends the objects to 0-simplices, morphisms to 1-simplices, and compositions to higher simplices. For instance, the composition $h=g\\circ f$ would be represented as a 2-simplex:\n\n\n\u003cimg align="center" src="https://i.upmath.me/svg/%5Cbegin%7Btikzcd%7D%0A%09%26%20b%20%5C%5C%0A%09a%20%26%26%20c%0A%09%5Carrow%5B%22%22%7Bname%3D0%2C%20anchor%3Dcenter%2C%20inner%20sep%3D0%7D%2C%20%22h%22\'%2C%20from%3D2-1%2C%20to%3D2-3%5D%0A%09%5Carrow%5B%22f%22%2C%20from%3D2-1%2C%20to%3D1-2%5D%0A%09%5Carrow%5B%22g%22%2C%20from%3D1-2%2C%20to%3D2-3%5D%0A%09%5Carrow%5Bshorten%20%3C%3D5pt%2C%20shorten%20%3E%3D5pt%2C%20Rightarrow%2C%20from%3D1-2%2C%20to%3D0%5D%0A%5Cend%7Btikzcd%7D" alt="\\begin{tikzcd}\n	\u0026amp; b \\\\\n	a \u0026amp;\u0026amp; c\n	\\arrow\u0026quot;\u0026quot;{name=0, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, \u0026quot;h\u0026quot;\', from=2-1, to=2-3]\n	\\arrow\u0026quot;f\u0026quot;, from=2-1, to=1-2]\n	\\arrow\u0026quot;g\u0026quot;, from=1-2, to=2-3]\n	\\arrowshorten \u0026lt;=5pt, shorten \u0026gt;=5pt, Rightarrow, from=1-2, to=0]\n\\end{tikzcd}" /\u003e\n\nThe vertical 2-morphism just being the identity, witnessing the equality of $g\\circ f$ and $h$. 3-simplices would correspond to the composition of 3 morphisms, which makes sense because it would need to include the data of the composition of pairs of morphisms within that set.\n\nWe are being informal here to get to the point, but it is not too difficult hopefully to see that this defines a simplicial set. In fact, it would appear the nerve really preserves all the information about the original category. This is indeed the case, as one shows that the nerve construction is fully faithful. In other words, the set of functors between two categories are in bijection with the morphisms between their nerves.\n\n# Reflective subcategories\nWhen a fully faithful functor $C\\to D$ admits a left adjoint, we call the left adjoint the reflector or localization. We say that $C$ is a [reflective subcategory](notes/ntpy/Definitions/Category theory/reflective subcategory.md) of $D$. \n\nLocalizations are of course central to many areas of mathematics, such as commutative algebra for example. Now, this isn\'t intended to be a video on localization or reflective subcategories, so I will just say a few things. \n\nFirstly, that this is an adjunction means that we aren\'t arbitrarily moving between categories: constructions and considerations in one category carry over, to an extent, to the other category. This is what we were hoping to do with the homotopy category: obtain a 1-category that tells us something about the higher category.\n\nSecondly, not every localization need arise in this manner, i.e. there are more general ways to define localization. However, a localization presented as a reflective subcategory does agree with the standard notion of universally inverting a class of morphisms. The strength of being a reflective subcategory is the following:\n\n1. the inclusion $C\\hookrightarrow D$ creates all limits that $C$ admits\n2. $D$ has all colimits that $C$ admits, formed by applying the reflector to the colimit in $C$.\n\nThis adjunction also constitutes an idempotent monad, by which we just mean that localizing twice does not provide any "extra" information.\n\n# Fundamental category functor\nSo we have a canonical way to move from small 1-categories to simplicial sets $$N:\\text{Cat}\\longrightarrow \\text{sSet}$$ and moreover this is a fully faithful functor. So we should try to construct its left adjoint, a localization functor.',lastmodified:"2022-01-27T04:08:13.224681505Z",title:"homotopy category, nerve, and decategorification"},"/notes/ntpy/Key-Ideas/Homotopy-theory/model-categories-and-derived-functors":{content:"# Idea\nConsider two model categories, so that there are notions of fibrant and cofibrant objects. It is sometimes the case that such a functor *almost* behaves homotopically, by which we mean (almost) preserves weak equivalences. To be precise, when we say \"almost\" we mean that it preserves weak equivalences in the subcategory of fibrant or cofibrant objects.\n\nThe model structure comes with a notion of (co)fibrant replacement. We define a new functor on the entire model category to 1) take the (co)fibrant replacement of an object 2) apply the original functor. This new functor preserves weak equivalences in the whole category. This is a derived functor.\n\nBut we don't just construct derived functors to show/prove that a given functor preserves weak equivalences, we can also construct them and analyze the extent to which they *fail* to preserve weak equivalences. If the functor is representable, for example, then this tells us things about the object it is representing.\n\nA crucial obstruction to a functor respecting weak equivalences is the failure of (co)limits to respect weak equivalences. This is clear in the context of homotopy equivalences: [(co)limits do not respect homotopy equivalence](notes/ntpy/Key Ideas/Homotopy theory/(co)limits do not respect homotopy equivalence.md). In general, we would like for this to be the case. Now, it goes without saying that adjunctions are ubiquitous. They have the property that right adjoints preserve limits, and left adjoints preserve colimits. It is natural to ask whether such an adjunction descends to the homotopy category, i.e. respects weak equivalences. We can do this by constructing the derived functors. (In the case that the adjunction does descend, we call it a Quillen adjunction).\n\nThis may seem divorced from the context in which most of us first encounter derived functors: when working with exact or left/right exact sequences. In particular, we derive functors which are left or right exact. However, this can be seen as a special case of deriving adjunctions. For example, the most prevalent derived functors are $\\text{Ext}$ and $\\text{Tor}$, and these are derived from the hom-tensor adjunction. But even if we didn't know we were working with an adjunction, we might restate that left exact functors preserve finite limits and right exact functors preserve finite colimits. So not only are all adjunctions left/right exact functors (when they are between appropriate categories, see [lr adjoints imply lr exactness](notes/ntpy/lr adjoints imply lr exactness.md)), the adjoint functor theorem tells also us precisely when a left exact functor is part of an adjunction. So although an adjunctions is stronger than the notion of left/right exact functors (adjoint functors preserve all (co)limits, not just finite ones [adjoints preserve (co)limits](notes/ntpy/Theorems/Category theory/adjoints preserve (co)limits.md)), a very interesting class of left/right exact functors are adjoint functors, besides the fact that adjunctions are of high interest themselves.\n# Examples\n## ker and coker\nLet $R$ be a commutative ring. We first claim that $\\text{ker}:\\text{Arr}(R\\text{Mod})\\to R\\text{Mod}$ is left exact.\n\n(diagram to be inserted)\n\nApplying $\\text{ker}$ induces a diagram $$0\\to \\text{ker}(f)\\overset{f'}{\\to}\\text{ker}(g)\\overset{g'}{\\to}\\text{ker}(h)\\to 0.$$ We will show that this is exact if we remove the last arrow. The only nontrivial thing to show is that $\\text{ker}(g')=0$. \n\nBy the initial assumption on exactness, $\\text{ker}(f)=0$, so the kernel of the second arrow is the image of the first which is 0. Then also $\\text{im}(f')=0$. Obviously $g$ restricted to $\\text{ker}(g)$ is 0, so $\\text{ker}(g')=0$.\n\nThe last part of the exact sequence is no longer (necessarily) exact since $\\text{im}(g')=0$ Again by assumption $\\ker(g)=\\text{im}(f)$ and $\\text{im}(g)=C$. By construction above $\\text{ker}(g')=\\text{ker}(g)$. It suffices to show $\\text{im}(f')=\\text{ker}(g)$. \n\n## Ext and Tor\nWhile Ext and Tor are commonly referred to as derived functors, we typically define them to be a little more than just that. Let $R$ be a commutative ring.\n\nThe functor we wish to approximate is $\\text{Hom}(A,-):\\text{Ch}_\\bullet(R\\text{Mod})\\to \\text{Ch}_\\bullet(R\\text{Mod})$. \n\n- In [inj proj resolutions](notes/ntpy/Definitions/Homological algebra/inj proj resolutions.md), we discuss that projective and injective resolutions play the role of cofibrant and fibrant replacement respectively (with respect to different model structures!).\n\nFor it to be a good idea to take the derived functor of $\\text{Hom}(A,-)$, we should expect it to be particularly well-behaved on a fibrant or cofibrant replacement. This property is that they are right and left exact sequences, respectively. This is an important property because we can apply $\\text{Hom}(A,-)$ to it and see if it preserves the exactness, which will tell us about $A$. If it doesn't preserve exactness we can measure the extent to which this is the case, which also tells us information about $A$. \n\nWith respect to the injective (and projective) model structure, weak equivalences are quasi-isomorphisms, i.e. maps between chain complexes that preserve homology groups. Exact functors preserve quasi-isomorphisms. Hence the above can be interpreted as measuring the extent to which $\\text{Hom}(A,-)$ preserves weak equivalences, which matches with our broader characterization of derived functors.\n\n Now, $\\text{Hom}(A,-)$ is exact iff $A$ is a projective module. It is always left exact, so taking a projective resolution (which extends to the left) does not tell us anything new: it is going to remain exact no matter what $A$ is. On the other hand, this is not necessarily the case for an injective resolution (which extends to the right). In other words, the failure of $\\text{Hom}(A,-)$ to preserve the exactness of the injective resolution is precisely the extent to which it fails to be an exact functor, i.e. how \"far\" $A$ is from being a projective module.\n \n Typically we don't speak of this derived functor specifically, but rather the resulting cohomology groups. This is a functor $R\\text{Mod}\\to \\text{Ab}$, which is the composite\n $$\n R\\text{Mod}\\to \\text{Ch}_\\bullet(R\\text{Mod})\\to \\text{Ch}_\\bullet(R\\text{Mod})\\to \\text{Ab},\n $$\n where the first map is the natural embedding, the second is the derived functor as described above, the third is taking the $i$th cohomology for some choice of $i$.\n Applying it to $B$, we call the result $\\text{Ext}_R^i(A,B)$ or the composite functor as $i$th right derived functor.\n \n The presentation above suggests we can extend our notion of $\\text{Ext}$ to more general settings.\n\nDually (adjointly?), the functor $T\\otimes (-)$ is exact iff $T$ is flat. It is always right exact. So taking the projective resolution and applying the functor measures how far $T$ is from being flat.\n# Related\n- [model category](notes/ntpy/Definitions/Homotopy theory/model category.md)",lastmodified:"2022-01-27T04:08:13.224681505Z",title:"model categories and derived functors"},"/notes/ntpy/Key-Ideas/Judgemental-vs.-propositional-equality":{content:"# Examples\n1.

Decompose the vector space into a direct sum of eigenspaces\n2. Determine how the images of the group in $GL(V)$ act on these eigenspaces\n\nThe reason this method is effective is because eigenspaces are a clear way to see invariant subspaces.  Suppose we have a decomposition $$V=\\bigoplus V_\\alpha$$ where $\\alpha$ is an eigenvalue for some $H\\in GL(V)$. Now suppose for every element $g\\in G$, the representation of $g$, which we will just call $g$, it was the case that for $v\\in V_\\alpha$, $gv\\in V_\\alpha$. In other words, suppose $v\\in V_\\alpha$ is an eigenvector of $g$ with eigenvalue $\\alpha$. If this was true for all $g$, then every $V_\\alpha$ would be an invariant subspace, so the representation would obviously be reducible.\n\nNow suppose we had a decomposition $$V=V_{-2}\\oplus V_0\\oplus V_2.$$ Suppose it was the case that every $g\\in G$ was such that for $g\\in V_\\alpha$, $gv\\in V_{\\alpha-2}$ and elements in $V_{-2}$ are annihilated. Then there are no nontrivial invariant subspaces, as any $g$ will either move us to a different eigenspace or be annihilated.\n\nWe'll also mention that it is not necessary to check what every single element does— it suffices to consider what the generators of the group do.\n\nHopefully it is clear that we can glean a lot of information from a decomposition of a vector space into eigenspaces. This is the approach we take here.\n\n# General discussion\n## A basis\nThe following is a basis for $\\mathfrak{sl}_2(\\mathbb{C})$: $$H=\\begin{pmatrix}1 \u0026 0 \\\\ 0 \u0026 -1\\end{pmatrix},\\quad X=\\begin{pmatrix}0 \u0026 1\\\\ 0 \u0026 0\\end{pmatrix},\\quad Y=\\begin{pmatrix}0\u0026 0\\\\1 \u00260\\end{pmatrix}$$\nIt satisfies the following properties: $$[H,X]=2X,\\quad [H,Y]=-2Y,\\quad [X,Y]=H.$$\n\nAs mentioned before, the choice of $H$ as a basis is sensible enough in our aim to decompose the vector space into eigenspaces. We will address why $X$ and $Y$ are sensible choices in retrospect.\n\n## A decomposition\nLet $V$ be an irreducible finite-dimensional [representation](notes/ntpy/Key Ideas/Representation theory/repreresentations of sl2C.md). We will use the following fact: $\\mathfrak{sl}_2(\\mathbb{C})$ is a semisimple [lie algebra](notes/ntpy/Definitions/Representation Theory/lie algebra.md). In [jordan decomposition](notes/ntpy/jordan decomposition.md), we discuss that the Jordan decomposition is preserved under a representation in this case, in our case implying that\n- The action of $H$ on $V$ is diagonalizable\n\n(This is because $H$ is diagonalizable, and we have just referenced the fact that this is a property preserved under a representation)\n\nThis allows us to decompose $V$ into the direct sum of eigenspaces: $$V=\\bigoplus V_\\alpha.$$ Specifically, for $v\\in V_\\alpha$, $$H(v)=\\alpha\\cdot v.$$ In other words, $v\\in V_\\alpha$ means $v$ is an eigenvector with eigenvalue $\\alpha$. (Diagonalizable implies that the sum of the dimensions of the eigenspaces is the dimension of the whole space, so that we may regard $V$ as a direct sum of eigenspaces of $H$).\n\nThis is similar to how we decomposed the abelian [representations of s3](notes/ntpy/Key Ideas/Representation theory/representations of s3.md). In that case, the nonabelian part of $S_3$ simply permutated the summands above in which vectors were in. To do something analagous here, we need to ask how $X$ and $Y$ act on the summands. It turns out that they also just carry each summand to another, i.e. permutes the summands.\n\n## Actions of other basis elements on decomposition\nLet us consider how $X$ acts on $V_\\alpha$. To do this, let us consider how $X$ acts on some $v\\in V_\\alpha$. This means we want to analyze $X(v)$ with respect to the decomposition above: \\begin{gather} HX(v)-XH(v)=[H,X](v), \\\\ HX(v)=X(\\alpha\\cdot v)+2X(v) = (\\alpha+2)\\cdot X(v).\\end{gather}\nThus:\n- If $v$ is an eigenvector for $H$ with eigenvalue $\\alpha$, then $X(v)$ is an eigenvector for $H$ with eigenvalue $\\alpha+2$.\n\nThis tells us that not only does $X$ simply permute the summands, it does so specifically: $$X:V_\\alpha\\to V_{\\alpha+2}.$$\n\nLikewise, $$Y:V_\\alpha\\to V_{\\alpha-2}.$$\n\n## 1st characterization of eigenvectors\nThe following is a corollary:\n- All (complex) eigenvalues $\\alpha$ are congruent mod 2.\n\nFor we have assumed that $V$ is irreducible, and by our discussion above, the subspace $V_{\\alpha+2k}$ is invariant under $H,X,Y$ hence under all of $\\mathfrak{sl}_2(\\mathbb{C})$. Thus it must be $V$ itself.\n- For every eigenvalue $\\beta$, there is an unbroken string of eigenvalues $\\beta, \\beta+2,\\dots,\\beta+2j$.\n\nWe will denote the last element in the above string by $n$. That the string terminantes is because we are dealing with finite dimensional representations, hence the decomposition into eigenspaces is finite. We have the following picture now:\n\n\u003cimg align=\"center\" src=\"https://i.upmath.me/svg/%5Cbegin%7Btikzcd%7D%0A%5Ccdots%20%5Carrow%5Br%2C%20%22X%22%2C%20bend%20left%3D49%5D%20%5Carrow%5B%22H%22'%2C%20loop%2C%20distance%3D2em%2C%20in%3D305%2C%20out%3D235%5D%20%26%20V_%7Bn-4%7D%20%5Carrow%5B%22H%22'%2C%20loop%2C%20distance%3D2em%2C%20in%3D305%2C%20out%3D235%5D%20%5Carrow%5Bl%2C%20%22Y%22%5D%20%5Carrow%5Br%2C%20%22X%22%2C%20bend%20left%3D49%5D%20%26%20V_%7Bn-2%7D%20%5Carrow%5B%22H%22'%2C%20loop%2C%20distance%3D2em%2C%20in%3D305%2C%20out%3D235%5D%20%5Carrow%5Bl%2C%20%22Y%22%5D%20%5Carrow%5Br%2C%20%22X%22%2C%20bend%20left%3D49%5D%20%26%20V_n%20%5Carrow%5B%22H%22'%2C%20loop%2C%20distance%3D2em%2C%20in%3D305%2C%20out%3D235%5D%20%5Carrow%5Bl%2C%20%22Y%22%5D%0A%5Cend%7Btikzcd%7D\" alt=\"\\begin{tikzcd}\n\\cdots \\arrowr, \u0026quot;X\u0026quot;, bend left=49] \\arrow\u0026quot;H\u0026quot;', loop, distance=2em, in=305, out=235] \u0026amp; V_{n-4} \\arrow\u0026quot;H\u0026quot;', loop, distance=2em, in=305, out=235] \\arrowl, \u0026quot;Y\u0026quot;] \\arrowr, \u0026quot;X\u0026quot;, bend left=49] \u0026amp; V_{n-2} \\arrow\u0026quot;H\u0026quot;', loop, distance=2em, in=305, out=235] \\arrowl, \u0026quot;Y\u0026quot;] \\arrowr, \u0026quot;X\u0026quot;, bend left=49] \u0026amp; V_n \\arrow\u0026quot;H\u0026quot;', loop, distance=2em, in=305, out=235] \\arrowl, \u0026quot;Y\u0026quot;]\n\\end{tikzcd}\" /\u003e\n$$ $$ $$ $$ $$ $$\n## 2nd characterization: a basis for $V$\nWe will show the following:\n- For $v\\in V_n$, the set $\\{v, Y(v), Y^2(v),\\dots\\}$ spans $V$\n\nThis is believable, but the difficulty is in the fact that we do not know right now that each $V_\\alpha$ is generated by a single vector, i.e. is one-dimensional. By exhibiting the set above as a basis(?) for $V$, we will have as a corollary that each $V_\\alpha$ is one-dimensional.\n\n**Proof**\nLet $W=\\text{span}\\{v, Y(v), Y^2(V),\\dots\\}$. ISTS $W$ is invariant, for by assumption $V$ is irreducible hence $W=V$. ISTS that $W$ is invariant under each basis element $H$, $X$, $Y$. It is invariant under $Y$ by definition. Each $Y^m(v)$ lives in the eigenspace $V_{n-2m}$, and these are invariant under $H$ by construction. So it remains to show that $W$ is invariant under $X$.\n\nWe will check each vector in turn, inductively. For $v$, we have $X(v)=0\\in V$.

If $a\\in K$ then $x^2 = a$ has a solution in $\\Omega$ since $\\Omega$ is algebraically closed. Then $(x^{q-1})^2 = (x^2)^{q-1}=a^{q-1}=1$  since $a\\in K$. But there are only two roots of $1$, namely $1$ and $-1$. If $x^{q-1}=1$ then $x\\in K$ by definition, so $a$ is a square. Otherwise, if $x^{q-1}=-1$, then $x\\not\\in K$ since $x$ does not have order $q-1$. Thus $a$ is not a square. $x^{q-1}=1$ is equivalently $a^{(p-1)/2}$. This shows that the squares coincide with the kernel of the map $K^\\ast\\to\\{\\pm 1\\}$ above.\n\nIt remains to show that the subgroup of squares has index to in $K^\\ast$. It suffices to show that the map $K^\\ast\\to\\{\\pm 1\\}$ above is surjective. This is because surjectivity would imply that $K^\\ast$ modulo the kernel has order 2, i.e. that the subgroup of squares has index 2. To that end, we just need to find a single element that maps to $-1$, and the generator of $K$ suffices: it has order $q-1$, so certainly its $\\frac{q-1}{2}$ power is not 1.",lastmodified:"2022-01-27T04:08:13.224681505Z",title:"Field Characteristic and Squares"},"/notes/ntpy/Theorems/Field-Theory/Finite-Fields-of-Prime-Power-Order":{content:"Let $p$ be prime, and $f$ be a positive integer.

It remains only to show that these factors are distinct. To that end, consider the (formal) derivative is $qx^{q-1}-1=-1$. But if the polynomial had a repeated root, then that root would also be a root of the derivative by considering the power and product rule. Hence it cannot have a repeated root. Another way of seeing this is by observing that $F$ and $F'$ are relatively prime in that the greatest common polynomial divisor is 1. Thus they have no common roots. \n\nTo see that the set of roots is a subfield, observe that the set can be expressed as\n$$\n\\{ x\\in|Omega \\mid \\text{Fr}^f(x)=x \\}\n$$\nwhere\n\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\text{Fr}:x\\mapsto x^p \\\\\n\\text{Fr}^f: x\\mapsto x^{pf}=x^q.\n\\end{gathered}\n\nHence the roots are precisely the set of fixed points of the $\\text{Fr}^f:\\Omega\\to \\Omega$, hence a subfield of $\\Omega$, as it is the image of a field homomorphism.\n\n_Pf of statement 2._\nLet $K^+$ be the additive group of $K$, and $|K|=q$.

Consider the elements $1, a,\\dots, a^{d-1}$. They are all different, and all are such that $x^d=1$.\n\nIn $K^\\ast$, we can rewrite the identity $x^d=1$ as $x^d-1=0$, since it is a subgroup of a field. This has no more than $d$ solutions by Bezout's theorem. Then they must be exactly the ones listed above, of which there are $d$. \n\nSo if an $a_i$ above itself has _order_ $d$, it has $d$ distinct powers that are also solutions to $x^d-1=0$.

Then $G_F\\text{Set}(S,F^s)$ is an etale algebra of degree (i.e. $\\text{dim}_FA$) $|S|$.\n\n*Proofs*\n**3.1**\nSince etale algebras are closed under (finite) products, it suffices to consider the case where $A=K$ is a finite seperable extension. In particular, if $A'=K\\times K'$ and $K\\otimes_F F'$, $K'\\otimes_F F'\\in\\text{Et}_{F'}$ then $A'\\otimes_F F'\\cong (K\\otimes_F F')\\times (K'\\otimes_F F')\\in\\text{Et}_{F'}$.\n\nBy the primitive element theorem, $K\\cong F(\\alpha)\\cong F[X]/(f)$ where $f$ is the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$.

The argument is virtually identical, but in the last step we observe that since $F^s$ is separable, $F^s[x]/(f_i)=F^s[x]/(x-\\alpha_i)=F^s$. \n\n(2=\u003e3) Take $F'=F^s$.\n\n(3=\u003e1) Suppose there exists $F'$ such that $A\\otimes_F F'$ is split etale. Then it is reduced (i.e. has no nilpotents) as it it the $n$-fold product of a fields, which has no nilpotents. Thus $A\\subset A\\otimes _F F'$ is also reduced.\n\n- Lemma 1: If $A$ is a finite reduced $F$-algebra, then it has at most $[A:F]$ maximal ideals.\n- Lemma 2: If $A$ is a finite reduced $F$-algebra, then $A$ is the product of fields.\n- Proof: Let $\\mathfrak{m}_1,\\dots,\\mathfrak{m}_n$ be maximal ideals of $A$. By [Chinese Remainder Theorem](notes/ntpy/Theorems/Ring Theory/Chinese Remainder Theorem.md), $$0\\to \\bigcap_i\\mathfrak{m}_i\\to A\\to\\prod_i A/\\mathfrak{m}_i\\to 0$$ is exact. By lemma 1, we may assume the $\\mathfrak{m}_i$ are all the maximal ideals. Then $\\bigcap_i\\mathfrak{m}_i=Nil(A)=0$ (the nilradical is 0 as there are no nilpotents). Thus $A$ is the product of fields.\n\nSo we may write $A\\cong\\prod_i K_i$, where $K_i=A/\\mathfrak{m}_i$ are fields. $K_i$ is a finite extension of $F$ (the quotient must contain $F$ as $F\\subset A$ and it is not contained in any maximal ideal). It remains to show that $K_i$ is separable.\n\nSuppose $K=K_i$ is inseparable. Then $\\text{char}(F)=p$ and there exists $\\alpha\\in K$ with minimal polynomial $g(x^p)$ for some $g(x)=x^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\\cdots+a_0\\in F[x]$ (this is just evidencing the fact that $[K:F]$ divides $p$). Now let $L=F(a_0^{1/p},\\dots,a_{n-1}^{1/p})$. Then $g(x^p)=h^p$ for some $h\\in L[x]$, namely $$g(x^p)=x^{pn}+a_{n-1}x^{p(n-1)}+\\cdots+a_0 = (x^n+a_{n-1}^{1/p}x^{n-1}+\\cdots+a_0^{1/p})^p=h^p.$$\nSo $$F(\\alpha)\\otimes_F L\\cong F[x]/(g(x^p))\\otimes_F L\\cong L[x]/(g(x^p))\\cong L[x]/(h^p).$$\nThis shows that $F(\\alpha)\\otimes_F L$ has nilpotent elements. But then so would $$F(\\alpha)\\otimes_F L\\subset K\\otimes_F L\\subset A\\otimes_F L\\subset A\\otimes_F L'$$ for any $L'$ containing both $L$ and $F'$ (certainly one exists, e.g. $LF'$). But $A\\otimes_F F'$ is split etale over $F'$ by assumption, hence $A\\otimes_F L'$ is split etale over $L'$ (Property 3.1). But $A\\otimes_F L'$ cannot have nilpotents, being the product of fields. This is a contradiction.\n\n**6**\nThe idea is that $K_i\\subset F^s$. The only reason this isn't true for all $K_i$ is that the value of the hom might be 0 on some $K_i$, but it cannot be 0 on all $K_i$. \n\n**7**\nLet $\\phi:A\\to B\\in\\text{Et}_F(A,B)$. Then for $B\\overset{i}{\\rightarrow}F^s\\in\\text{Et}_F(B,F^s)$, there is an induced map $(A\\overset{\\phi}{\\rightarrow}B\\overset{i}{\\rightarrow}F^s)\\in\\text{Et}_F(A,F^s)$.

If we denote by $_aM_n(K)$ the algebra $M_n(K)$ equipped with the $a_\\sigma$ $G$-action, then $$\\phi:_aM_n(K)\\overset{\\sim}{\\to}A\\otimes_k K$$ is a $G$-equivariant isomorphism. While this is tautologically $G$-equivariant, we should verify that $a_\\sigma$ is a $K$-automorphism of $M_n(K)$. But this is because $\\phi$, $\\sigma_A$, and $\\phi^{-1}$ are all $K$-isomorphisms.\n\nBy [Galois descent](notes/ntpy/Galois descent.md), $$({}_aM_n(K))^G\\cong A.$$ Being a matrix algebra, there is the determinant map $\\text{det}$ on $M_n(K)$. **We wish to use the determinant to induce a map $A\\to k$.**  We can do this by "descending" the domain of $\\text{det}$ (i.e. $M_n(K)$) to $A$, but we can only do this if $\\text{det}$ is $G$-equivariant. \n\nMore specifically, we need to check $\\text{det}$ is $G$-equivariant with respect to ${}_a M_n(K)$, as it is actually already $G$-equivariant wrt $M_n(K)$ (equipped with the usual entry-wise $G$-action): indeed, the determinant is given as the sum of products of elements in $K$, and actions of $G$ are in particular $K$-homomorphisms. So we need to check $\\text{det}$ is $G$-equivariant with respect to ${}_aM_n(K)$. \n\nFor all $\\sigma\\in G$, $a_\\sigma$ is a $K$-automorphism of $M_n(K)$ hence is determined by an invertible matrix $C_\\sigma\\in GL_n(K)$. Then \n\n\\begin{align}\n\\text{det}(a_\\sigma(M))=\u0026 \\text{det}(C_\\sigma\\sigma(M)C_\\sigma^{-1})\\\\\n=\u0026 \\text{det}(C_\\sigma)\\text{det}(\\sigma(M))\\text{det}(C_\\sigma^{-1}) \\\\\n=\u0026 \\text{det}(\\sigma(M)) \\\\\n=\u0026 M.\n\\end{align}\n\nSo indeed $$\\text{det}:{}_aM_n(K)\\to K$$ is $G$-equivariant. So we can use Galois descent (take $G$-invariants) to induce a map $({}_aM_n(K))^G\\to K^G$, i.e. a map $$\\text{Nrd}:A\\to k,$$ called the *reduced norm*. \n\nPerforming the above with the trace instead of determinant yields a map $$\\text{Trd}:A\\to k$$ called the *reduced trace*.\n\n# Relation to norm, trace\nThe usual norm is defined as follows: given $a\\in A$, the norm of $A$, denoted $N(a)$, the the determinant of the linear map determined by multiplication by $x$, e.g. there is a $k$-linear map $L_a:A\\to A$ which is multiplication on the left, say. This is $k$-invariant because $k$ is the center of $A$, hence $L_a(kx)=akx=kax=kL_k(x)$. Then $N(a)=\\text{det}(L_a)$. \n\nHowever this is a bit clunky, for reasons we will now discuss. Remember that we can embed $A\\hookrightarrow M_n(K)$. Thus $a$ can be regarded as an $(n\\times n)$-matrix. So the map $L_a$ is represented by an $(n^2\\times n^2)$-matrix, in particular by the block diagonal matrix $\\text{diag}(M_a,\\dots,M_a)$ where $M_a$ is the matrix associated to $a$. The determinant of each of these blocks is $\\text{Nrd}(a)$, the the determinant of $L_a$ is $(\\text{Nrd}(a))^n$.\n\n# Properties\n1. $\\text{Nrd}$ does not depend on choice of $\\phi$ or $K$.\n\n*Proofs*\n**1**\nChanging $\\phi$ amounts to replacing $a_\\sigma$ with a different automorphism, i.e. a different invertible matrix $C_\\sigma$, which vanishes in the calculation regardless. \n\nSuppose $L/k$ is another finite Galois splitting field extension such that $A\\otimes_k L\\cong M_n(L)$.',lastmodified:"2022-01-27T04:08:13.228681508Z",title:"reduced norm, trace"},"/notes/ntpy/ring-of-convergent-power-series":{content:"# Definition\nLet $\\mathbb{C}[[x]]$ denote the ring of formal power series in $\\mathbb{C}$. \n- $\\mathbb{C}\\{x\\}\\subset\\mathbb{C}[[x]]$ is the subring consisting of those power series $$\\sum a_n x^n$$ which converge in some neighbhorhood of zero.\n- Let $\\mathcal{O}_n$ be the subring of power series in $n$ variables that converge in some neighborhood of 0.\n\nFor every $1\\leq j\\leq n$, we write $$\\partial_j(f)=\\partial f/\\partial x_j$$ so that $\\partial_j:f\\mapsto \\partial_j(f)$ is the derivation with respect $x_j$. \n\n# Properties\n1. $\\mathbb{C}\\{x\\}$ is a $\\mathbb{C}$-algebra\n2. $\\mathbb{C}\\{x\\}$ is a local ring.\n3.

Let $\\mathcal{O}_M^j$ (with $j\\leq k$) denote the sheaf whose values on an open subset $U$ (i.e. its sections) are $C^j$-functions $U\\to\\mathbb{R}$. This is a sheaf much for the same reasons as above.\n\nWhen $j=k$, this sheaf is called the *structure sheaf* and denoted $\\mathcal{O}_M$. Even after removing zero functions we obtain a sheaf: the nonzero $CC^k$ functions also form a sheaf, denoted $\\mathcal{O}_X^\\times$.\n\n**Differential forms**\nLetting $M$ be an $n$-dimensional $C^k$-manifold as above, the differential forms (of degree $p$) form a sheaf, denoted $\\Omega_M^p$.\n\n**Holomorphic functions**\nLet $X$ be a complex manifold. Given an open set $U\\subset X$, a holomorphic function $f:U\\to\\mathbb{C}$ is one such that $f$ is complex differentiable at every $z\\in U$. \n\nTo each $U$ we can associate a set(?) $F(U)$ of holomorphic function $U\\to\\mathbb{C}$. This determines a presheaf: if $V\\subset U$ then by restriction every holomorphic $U\\to\\mathbb{C}$ determines a holomorphic $V\\to \\mathbb{C}$. Hence the inclusion $V\\hookrightarrow U$ induces a map $F(U)\\to F(V)$. \n\nThis is a sheaf because:\n- (locality) Suppose $\\{U_i\\}_{i\\in I}$ is an open cover of $U$, and $s,t\\in F(U)$ are such that $s|_{U_i}=t|_{U_i}$ for all $U_i$. This means the restrictions of the holomorphic $s,t$ to $U_i$ are all equal. So there value on every point in $U$ is identical, and so $s=t$.\n- (gluing) Suppose for each $i\\in I$ there exists a section $s_i\\in F(U_i)$ such that $s_i|_{U_i\\cap U_j}=s_j|_{U_i\\cap U_j}$ for all $i,j\\in I$. We need to construct a holomorphic $s:U\\to\\mathbb{C}$ whose restriction to $U_i$ is $s_i$. To begin, for any $z\\in U$ define $s(z)=s_i(z)$ where $z\\in U_i$. If $z\\in U_j$ with $i\\neq j$, $z\\in U_i\\cap U_j$ so by assumption  $s_i(z)=s_j(z)$ and this is well-defined. \n\nHow might we interpret the [stalk]() $F_z$ for some $z\\in X$? It is the set of all functions holomorphic at $z$ (meaning there exists some neighborhood of $z$ such that the function is differentiable at every point in that neighborhood). To see this, consider the definition $$F_z\\coloneqq \\lim_{\\underset{z\\in U}{\\rightarrow}}F(U).$$\nThis is isomorphic to $$\\left(\\bigsqcup F(U)\\right)/\\sim$$\nwhere we identify elements that are eventually equal in the directed system. In our case, if $s\\in F(U_i)$, $t\\in F(U_j)$ become equal in some $F(V)$, firstly this means that $V\\in U_i\\cap U_j$. Why would we want to identify $s$ and $t$ just because they agree on this open subset? A key property of complex functions is that the behavior of the function locally (i.e. the germ) is enough to reconstruct the function on any connected open subset on which the function is everywhere defined (analytic continuation).\n\n- is every restriction $F(U)\\to F(V)$ injective? No, we cannot assume $U$ is connected.\n\nSee: [Holomorphic function](notes/ntpy/Definitions/Holomorphic function.md)\n\n**Regular functions on a variety**\nGiven \n\n[Regular map](notes/ntpy/Definitions/Algebraic geometry/Regular map.md)",lastmodified:"2022-01-27T04:08:13.228681508Z",title:"sheaf"},"/notes/ntpy/sheafification":{content:"# Examples\n**Locally constant sheaf**\nOne can show that $\\mathbb{C}_X$ is a sheaf on $X$ whose [stalk]()s are all equal to $\\mathbb{C}$. \n- Line bundles are not necessarily constant sheaves, though.

Thus $G/\\overline{1_G}$ is a Hausdorff topological group.\n\n*Proofs*\n**1**\nMultiplication is already required to be continuous, and the continuous inverse is multiplication on the same side by the inverse element. The two sets are in bijection as well.\n\n**2**\nLet $g\\in G\\setminus H$. Then $gh\\not\\in H$ since $h^{-1}\\in H$ and this would imply $ghh^{-1}=g\\in H$. In particular, $g\\in gH$. So $$G\\setminus H=\\bigcup_{g\\in  G\\setminus H}gH.$$ By Property (1), each $gH$ is open, as it is just a translation of an open set (H). Thus $G\\setminus H$ is open, so $H$ is closed.\n\nFor the subparts, what is left is the case where $H$ is neither open nor closed.\n\n**3**\nBy definition, open sets in the quotient topology are those whose preimage is open, whence $q$ is tautologically continuous. Suppose $U\\subset G$ is open. We need to show that $q(U)$ is open. This true iff $q^{-1}(q(U))$ is open, as $q$ is continuous. Observe that $$q^{-1}(q(U))=\\bigcup_{h\\in H}hU.$$ $U$ is open and $hU$ is a translation, so by Property 1 $hU$ is open, and so $q^{-1}(q(U))$ is open.\n\n**4**\nISTS that multiplication and inversion are continuous. \n\nRegarding multipilication: for $[xy]\\in G/H$, an open neighborhood $S'$ has preimage (under quotient) an open set $S$ in $G$ containing $xy$. Since multipilication map in $G$ is continuous, there exist neighborhoods $x\\in U$, $y\\in V$ such that $UV\\subset S$. Under quotient, these correspond to open sets $[x]\\in U'$, $[y]\\in V'$. It remains to show that $U'V'\\subset S'$, but this is immediate.\n\nRegarding inversion: let $[x^{-1}]\\in V'$ be a neighborhood. We need to show that there exists a neighborhood $[x]\\in U'$ such that $(U')^{-1}\\subset V'$. The quotient is continuous, so there exists a neighborhood $x^{-1}\\in V$ such that $[V]\\subset V'$. Inversion is continuous in $G$, so there exists a neighborhood $x\\in U$ such that $U^{-1}\\subset V$. The image of this under quotient is an open set $U'$, and this is the desired set.\n\n**5**\nProperty (2) is not enough, as it could be the case that $H$ is neither open nor closed.\n\nLet $a,b\\in \\overline{H}$.
