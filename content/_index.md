title: ðŸ–Š rooney's math notes
---
I use Obsidian to keep track of my notes, and I've ported those here. Click the search bar or type '/' to find a specific note, 
see on one of the featured notes below, or use the interactive graph at the bottom (which displays "connections" between notes, 
represented as dots).

## Featured
- [Homotopy category, nerve, and decategorification](<notes/ntpy/Key Ideas/Homotopy theory/homotopy category, nerve, and decategorification.md>)
- [Representations of sl2C](<notes/ntpy/Key Ideas/Representation theory/repreresentations of sl2C.md>)
- [Product type](<notes/ntpy/Definitions/Logic/Product type.md>)

## Bugs
The Quartz platform I'm using doesn't currently support the type of links I use in Obsidian. I've written a program which I send my 
all my notes through before uploading them here, which tries to edit them so that they are Quartz-compatible, but there are some 
bugs. Most notably,
- "gather" and "align" environments are broken, as Obsidian requires them to be surrounded by "$$" while this causes MathJax to not render them.
- Obsidian supports links to pages that have not been created yetâ€” my program changes those links to point to the path "", which happens to be the home page. Thus the home page appears as the largest dot on the graph.
