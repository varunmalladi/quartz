# Totient numbers
For a definition, see [[Euler totient function]].

A theorem of Ford states that for every $k\geq 2$ there exists a totient number of multiplicity $k$. 

The case of $k=1$ is unknown- it is Carmichael's conjecture that no such totient number exists.

This suggests that totient numbers are not very good at classifying $n$. Nonetheless, it might be interesting to consider how the totient numbers partition $\mathbb{N}$. I imagine this question is closely tied to the distribution of $\phi(n)$.
