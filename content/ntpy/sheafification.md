# Examples
**Locally constant sheaf**
One can show that $\mathbb{C}_X$ is a sheaf on $X$ whose [stalk]()<>)s are all equal to $\mathbb{C}$. 
- Line bundles are not necessarily constant sheaves, though. Line bundles are fiber isomorphic to $\mathbb{C}$, but their stalks are isomorphic to $\mathcal{O}_{x\in X}$, which is local unlike $\mathbb{C}$.
