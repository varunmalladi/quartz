# Definition
Let $\mathbb{C}[[x]]$ denote the ring of formal power series in $\mathbb{C}$. 
- $\mathbb{C}\{x\}\subset\mathbb{C}[[x]]$ is the subring consisting of those power series $$\sum a_n x^n$$ which converge in some neighbhorhood of zero.
- Let $\mathcal{O}_n$ be the subring of power series in $n$ variables that converge in some neighborhood of 0.

For every $1\leq j\leq n$, we write $$\partial_j(f)=\partial f/\partial x_j$$ so that $\partial_j:f\mapsto \partial_j(f)$ is the derivation with respect $x_j$. 

# Properties
1. $\mathbb{C}\{x\}$ is a $\mathbb{C}$-algebra
2. $\mathbb{C}\{x\}$ is a local ring.
3. Let $1\leq j\leq n$ and $f\in\mathcal{O}_n$. Then $$[\partial_j,i(f)]=i(\partial_j(f))$$ holds in the ring $H(\mathcal{O}_n)$ (where $H(A)$ denotes $\mathbb{C}$-linear endomorphisms of $A$, where $A$ is a $\mathbb{C}$-algebra).
