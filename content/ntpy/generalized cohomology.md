# Idea
We wish here to record the axioms of cohomology. In addition, we take the perspective that cohomology is a certain hom-functor (see [[cohomology is dual to homotopy]]). It will then become clearer, hopefully, why the axioms are what they are. In short, we wish to motivate these axioms.

Most abstractly, cohomology is about assigning abelian groups to a topological space in order to better understand the homotopy of that space. This is another instance of "linearization" that pervades mathematics: reducing badly behaved problems to better behaved ones (e.g. representation theory). 

Another thing we can do to study $X$ is consider maps from $X$ into a very simple space. Perhaps this could by the Eilenberg-Maclane space $K(G,n)$, which has its only nontrivial homotopy group $\pi_n(K(G,n))=G$. Implicit in introducing this space and notation is that we wish to study $X$ for all $n$. This is like the problem of finding all homotopy groups of $X$. So we will actually need to consider a whole sequence of hom-sets, one for each $n$.

Putting these two approaches together, we can aim to study $X$ by considering a sequence of hom-sets $\text{Hom}(X,A_n)$ which also has the structure of an abelian group.
