- Projective, quasi-projective algebraic sets
- if Y is quasi projective, then for all y there is an open affine neighborhood containing y
- regular maps between quasi projective sets
- given such a regular map, there exists a covering of the domain such that the map can be written componentwise as homogeneous polynomials. Conversely, such a map is regular.\
- conics
- Veronese map
- Segre map
- the image of a regular map from a projective set to a quasi projective set is closed
	- regular function on projective set is constant (version of Louiville's theorem)
	- subset of a quasi projective set is closed iff Y is closed "locally", i.e. intersection with each cover of X is closed
