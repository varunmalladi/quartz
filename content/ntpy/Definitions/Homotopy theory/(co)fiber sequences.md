# Idea
Taking the ordinary fiber twice is always trivial, meaning given a morphism $f:X\to Y$, we can take the fiber once to obtain $\text{fib}(f)\to X\to Y$. We can then take the fiber of the first morphism, and this is  what we claim to be completely trivial:
$$
\ast\cong \text{fib}(f_1)\overset{f_2}{\longrightarrow}\text{fib}(f)\overset{f_1}{\longrightarrow}X\overset{f}{\longrightarrow} Y.$$
Crucially, taking the homotopy fiber twice (or more) is not trivial. Likewise, taking the homotopy cofiber repeatedly is not trivial. The (co)fiber sequences are the result of repeatedly taking (co)fibers, and while they themselves are not exact sequences, they do become exact when taking hom-sets.
