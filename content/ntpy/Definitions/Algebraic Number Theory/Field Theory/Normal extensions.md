# Idea
A normal extension $L/K$ is one that does not live "between" irreducible polynomialsâ€” it either contains all of the roots or none of them, similar to the idea of the [Prime Avoidance Lemma](notes/ntpy/Theorems/Ring Theory/Prime Avoidance Lemma.md)<notes/ntpy/Theorems/Ring Theory/Prime Avoidance Lemma.md>).

# Definition
Let $K$ be an algebraic extension of $k$ contained in an algebraic closure $\overline{k}$ of $k$.

**Definition.** The extension $K/k$ is called *normal* if one of the following equivalent conditions hold:
1. All $\sigma\in\sum_{K/k}^{\overline{k}/k}$ have the same image (in particular they all induce automorphisms of $K$)
2. $K$ is the [splitting field]()<notes/ntpy/Definitions/Algebraic Number Theory/Field Theory/Splitting field.md>) of a family of polynomials in $k[T]$.
3. Every irreducible polynomial in $k[T]$ which has a root in $K$ splits into linear factors in $K$

# Properties
Let $k\subset K\subset L$ be a tower of algebraic extensions.

1. If $L/k$ is normal then $L/K$ is normal. 
2. [Fundamental thm of Galois Theory](notes/ntpy/Theorems/Field Theory/Fundamental thm of Galois Theory.md)<notes/ntpy/Theorems/Field Theory/Fundamental thm of Galois Theory.md>): $M/k$ is normal iff $H\triangleleft G$
