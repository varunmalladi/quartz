# Properties
1. $G$ is always uncountable.
2. $G$ is compact Hausdorff (hence a [profinite group](notes/ntpy/profinite group.md)<notes/ntpy/profinite group.md>) under the [Krull topology](notes/ntpy/Definitions/Algebraic Number Theory/Field Theory/Krull topology.md)<notes/ntpy/Definitions/Algebraic Number Theory/Field Theory/Krull topology.md>).
