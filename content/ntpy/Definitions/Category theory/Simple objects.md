# Definition
Let us work in a category with a [[Zero object|zero object]].

**Definition.** A *simple* object $A$ is one whose only [[Subobjects, quotient objects|quotient objects]] are $A$ and $0$.

# Examples
1. In $\text{Vect}_k$, the only simple object up to isomorphism is $k$ itself. 
	1. Any vector space of higher dimension can be mapped surjectively to one of lower non-zero dimension. $k$ can only be mapped surjectively to itself or to 0.
