In a [[Monoidal category|monoidal category]], a _unit object_ is the unit of the tensor product, i.e. $a\otimes u\simeq a$ and $u\otimes a\simeq a$ for any $a$ in the category.

## Examples
- In $\text{Vect}_K$, the unit object is $K$, regarded as a vector space over itself.
- The unit object of the category of linear representations over $\text{Vect}_K$ is the trivial representation which sends each $g\in G$ to the identity automorphism on $K$. [[Representation of a group]]
