title: "Holomorphic function"
---

Let $f$ be a complex valued function of a single variable.

On an open set:
**Definition.** A function $f(z)$ is holomorphic on an open set $U$ if it is (complex-)differentiable at every pointin $U$.

On a non-open set:
**Definition.** A function $f(z)$ is holomorphic on a non-open set $A$ if it is holomorphic on some open set containing $A$.

At a point:
**Definition.** A function $f(z)$ is holomorphic at $z_o$ if it is differentiable on some neighborhood of $z_o$.
