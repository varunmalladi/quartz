### Abstract Riemann Surface
In the abstract sense, a Riemann surface is a real, 2-dimensional manifold with a useful notion of analytic functions.

### Concrete Riemann Surface
Concretely, a surface is a locally closed subset which is locally the graph of a multi-valued function.

### Singular vs. non-singular
Of course, if the RS is globally homeomorphic to $\mathbb{C}$ then extended the notions of analysis is trivial. Such a RS is called _singular_. Otherwise it is _nonsingular_.
