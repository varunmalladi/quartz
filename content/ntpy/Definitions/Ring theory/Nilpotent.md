Let $A$ be a ring.

**Definition.** An element $a\in A$ in _nilpotent_ if there exists $N\in\mathbb{N}$ such that $a^N=0$.

**Definition.** The elements of a ring form an ideal $Nil(A)$ called the _nilradical_. 

See [Radical](notes/ntpy/Definitions/Ring theory/Radical.md)<notes/ntpy/Definitions/Ring theory/Radical.md>) for more information.

### Properties
1. A nilpotent element is a zero divisor, but the converse is not true in general.
- If $a$ and $b$ are nilpotent then so is $ab$ and $a+b$.
- The sum of a nilpotent element and a unit is a unit.
