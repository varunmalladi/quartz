**Definition.** Let $K$ be a field and let $R$ be a vector space over $K$ equipped with a bilinear product:
- $(x+y)\cdot z = x\cdot z+y\cdot z$
- $z\cdots (x+y)=z\cdot x+z\cdot y$
- $(ax)\cdot (by)=(ab)(x\cdot y)$
Then $R$ is called an _algebra_.

**Definition.** An algebra $R$ over $K$ is said to be _finitely generated_ if there exist $f_1,\dots,f_n\in R$ such that any $a\in R$ is the evaluation of a degree $n$ polynomial in $K$ at the basis elements, i.e. $a=F(f_1,\dots,f_n)$ where $F\in K[x_1,\dots,x_n]$.

**Corollary.** If $R$ is finitely generated as an algebra, then it is also a [Noetherian ring](notes/ntpy/Definitions/Ring theory/Noetherian ring.md)<notes/ntpy/Definitions/Ring theory/Noetherian ring.md>).
