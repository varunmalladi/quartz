# Definition
- A *ringed space* $(X,\mathcal{O}_X)$ is a topological space $X$ together with a [sheaf](notes/ntpy/sheaf.md)<notes/ntpy/sheaf.md>) $\mathcal{O}_X$ of (perhaps commutative) rings.
	- $\mathcal{O}_X$ is called the *structure sheaf* of $X$.
- A *locally ringed space* is a ringed space such that every [stalk]()<>) of $\mathcal{O}_X$ is a local ring.
