The phenomena where an infinite process terminates.

### Examples
- Nilpotent elements in a ring stabilize under the operation of taking powers [[Nilpotent]]
- Noetherian rings satsify the ascending chain condition, meaning every infinite increasing sequence of ideals stops growing at a finite stage [[Noetherian ring]]
