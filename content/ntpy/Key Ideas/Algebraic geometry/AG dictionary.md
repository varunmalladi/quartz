Affine algebraic set $X$ | f.g. $K$-algebra without nilpotents $A=K[X]$.
Embedding $X\subset\mathbb{A}^n$ | Choice of generators of $A$
$f:X\to Y$ | $f^\ast: K[Y]\to K[X]$
$X$ is irreducible (an affine variety) | $A=K[X]$ is a domain
$f$ is dominant ($\overline{f(X)}=Y$) | $f^\ast$ is injective
$f$ is a closed embedding | $f^\ast$ is surjective

(Closed embedding means $f$ is an isomorphism onto its image and $f(X)$ is closed in $Y$.)
