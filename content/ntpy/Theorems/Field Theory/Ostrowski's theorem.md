For a prime $p$, let $v_p(x)$ be the largest $n$ such that $p^n$ that divides $x$.

**Theorem.** Let $\|\cdot\|$ be a nontrivial [absolute value]()<notes/ntpy/Definitions/Ring theory/Absolute value.md>) on $\mathbb{Q}$. Then either
1. $\|x\|=s^{-v_p(x)}$ where $x\in\mathbb{R}_{>1}$ and $p$ is prime, or
2. $\|x\|=|x|^\alpha$, where $0<\alpha\leq 1$ and $|\cdot|$ is the standard absolute value.

The second absolute value is necessarily archimedean.
