title: "map of modules induces chain map"
---

Let $f:M\to N$ be a map of $A$-modules.

1. Given a resolution for $N$ (i.e. an exact sequence $Q_\ast\to N\to 0$) and a projective complex over $M$ (see [chain complex](<notes/ntpy/Definitions/Homological algebra/chain complex.md>)) (i.e. a chain complex $P_\ast\to M\to 0$ where the $P_\ast$ are projective modules), then there exists a collection of  maps $f_i:P_i\to Q_i$ which determine a chain map. Moreover, this map is unique up to [chain homotopy](<notes/ntpy/Definitions/Homological algebra/chain homotopy.md>).
