**Definition.** Let $\text{ExtF}_k$ denote the category of field extensions over $k$. 
- Its objects are field extensions over $k$, i.e. fields $K$ such that there is a natural inclusion $k\hookrightarrow K$.
- Its morphisms are homomorphisms of extensions, i.e. field homomorphisms $K_1\to K_2$ which fix the subfield $k$.

Because every field homomorphism is injective, there is some sense in which the existence of an arrow in $\text{ExtF}_k$, i.e. a homomorphism of extensions $K_1\to K_2$, tells us that $K_2$ contains the data of $K_1$.
