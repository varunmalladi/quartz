# Statement
**1**
Let $X$ be an $\mathbb{R}$-linear space, $p$ a real-valued function on $X$ such that
- (positive homogeneity) $p(ax)=ap(x)$ for all $a>0$, $x\in X$.
- (subadditivity) $p(x+y)\leq p(x)+p(y)$ for all $x,y\in X$.
Let $Y\subset X$ be a linear subspace. Suppose $l$ is a linear functional on $Y$, i.e. $l\in Y^\ast$, that is dominated by $p$ (i.e. $l(y)\leq p(y)$ for all $y\in Y$). Then
- $l$ can be extended to all of $X$ as a linear functional dominated by $p$.
