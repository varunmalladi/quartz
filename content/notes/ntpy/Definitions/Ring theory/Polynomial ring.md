# Properties
## Prime ideals
If $R$ is a [Principal ideal domain](notes/ntpy/Definitions/Ring theory/Principal ideal domain.md), then the prime ideals of $R[y]$ are of the following form:
- $(0)$
- $(f(y))$ where $f$ is irreducible
- $(p,f(y))$ where $p\in R$ is prime and $f(y)$ is irreducible in $(R/p)[y]$.
(see answer at https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/56916/what-do-prime-ideals-in-kx-y-look-like)
## Graded ring structure
(See [Graded ring](notes/ntpy/Definitions/Ring theory/Graded ring.md) for definitions and properties of graded rings.)
