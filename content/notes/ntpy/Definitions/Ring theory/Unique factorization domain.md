title: "Unique factorization domain"
---

**Definition.** A ring $R$ is said to be _factorial_ if it can be represented uniquely (up to the multiplication by invertible elements) as a product of irreducible elements (an element is reducible if it can be written as the product of two noninvertible elements).

### Properties
- It is [integrally closed](<notes/ntpy/Definitions/Ring theory/Integral element.md>)

### Examples
- Any [PID](<notes/ntpy/Definitions/Ring theory/Principal ideal domain.md>) is factorial.
