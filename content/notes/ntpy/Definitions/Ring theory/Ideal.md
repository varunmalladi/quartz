Let $A$ be a commutative ring with unit.

# Idea
Given a subset $S\subset A$, the definition of an ideal is precisely the conditions necessary to make $A/S$ a ring:
- For $A/S$ to be an additive group, $S$ must be an additive subgroup because $A$ is in particular an additive group.
- For $A/S$ to be a multiplicative semigroup, any $a\in A$ multiplied by $s\in S$ should go to zero in the quotient, hence $as\in S$.
# Definition

**Definition.** An ideal $I\subset A$ is an additive subgroup such that $aI\in I$ for all $a\in A$.

### Kinds
- Principal: ideal is generated by a single element
- [Prime ideal](ntpy/Definitions/Ring theory/Prime ideal.md)
- [Maximal ideal](ntpy/Definitions/Ring theory/Maximal ideal.md)

**Definition.** Two ideals $a$ and $b$ are called _coprime_ if $a+b=A$.

**Theorem. ([Chinese Remainder Theorem](ntpy/Theorems/Ring Theory/Chinese Remainder Theorem.md))** If $I_1,\ddots,I_k$ are pairwise [coprime ideals](ntpy/Definitions/Ring theory/Ideal.md), then
1. $I_1\cap\cdots\cap I_k=I_1\cdot \dots \cdot I_k$
2. $\phi:A\to\prod_i A/I_i$ is surjective

# Common notations
Let $\mathcal{O}$ be an [Integral domain](ntpy/Definitions/Ring theory/Integral domain.md), $k$ its field of fractions. Suppose $I,j$ are $\mathcal{O}$-submodules in $k$.
- $I^{-1}\coloneqq\{x\in k\mid xI\subset\mathcal{O}\}$
- $\mathcal{O}(I)\coloneqq\{x\in k\mid xI\subset I\}$
- $I+J\coloneqq\{x+y\mid x\in I, y\in J\}$
- $IJ\coloneqq\{\sum x_iy_i\mid x_i\in I,y_i\in J\}$ where the sum is finite.

## Properties
1. There is a one-to-one order-preserving correspondence between the ideals $B$ of $A$ and the ideals $B'$ of $A/I$, given by $B=\phi^{-1}(B')$ where $\phi$ is the natural quotient $A\to A/I$.
2. The kernel and image of a ring homomorphism are ideals, the domain modulo the kernel is isomorphic to the image.
