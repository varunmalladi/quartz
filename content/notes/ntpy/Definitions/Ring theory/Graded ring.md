# Definition
**Definition.** A _graded ring_ is a ring $S$ together with a decomposition $$S=\bigoplus_{d\geq 0}S_d$$ of $S$ into a direct sum of abelian groups $S_d$ such that $$S_d\cdot S_e\subseteq S_{d+e}\quad\forall d,e\geq 0.$$

## Homogeneous items
### Elements
**Definition.** An element is _homogeneous of degree $d$_ if it belongs to $S_d$ for some $d\geq 0$. 
### Ideals
**Definition.** An ideal $\mathfrak{a}\subseteq S$ is called _homogeneous_ if
$$
\mathfrak{a}=\bigoplus_{d\geq 0}(\mathfrak{a}\cap S_d).
$$

# Properties
1. Any element in $S$ can be written as a finite sum of homogeneous elements.
2. Let $I$ be a homogeneous ideal of $S$. Then $$S/I=\bigoplus_{j\geq 0}S_j/I_j.$$

## Of homogeneous ideals
Let $\mathfrak{a}$ be a homogeneous ideal.

1. An ideal is homogeneous if and only if it can be generated by homogeneous elements.
2. The sum, product, intersection, and radical of homogeneous ideals are homogeneous.
3. To show that $\mathfrak{a}$ is a [prime ideal](notes/ntpy/Definitions/Ring theory/Prime ideal.md), it suffices to show the condition is satisfied for homogeneous elements
	1.  The condition that $fg\in\mathfrak{a}$ implies $f\in\mathfrak{a}$ or $g\in\mathfrak{a}$.
