title: "split sequence"

# Definition
A sequence $$0\to L\overset{i}{\longrightarrow} M\overset{\pi}{\longrightarrow}N\to 0$$ is said to split if one of the following holds:
1. There exists $s:N\to M$ such that $s\circ\pi=1_N$.
2. There exists $p:M\to L$ such that $p\circ i=1_L$.

This will imply $M\cong L\oplus N$.
