title: "adjoint representation"
---

# Definition
There are two closely related notions that may be mixed up in terminology. By the representation $Ad$ we mean a representation from a [lie group]() to its [lie algebra](notes/ntpy/Definitions/Representation Theory/lie algebra.md) (viewed just as a vector space), where by the representation $ad$ we mean a representation from a lie algebra to itself.
# Definition
Let $G$ be a Lie group with lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. Then

\begin{gather}
Ad:G\to GL(\mathfrak{g})\\
A\mapsto A(-)A^{-1}
\end{gather}

and

\begin{gather}
ad:\mathfrak{g}\to GL(\mathfrak{g}) \\
A\mapsto [A,-]
\end{gather}
