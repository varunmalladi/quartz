title: "Unit object"
---

In a [monoidal category](<notes/ntpy/Definitions/Category theory/Monoidal category.md>), a _unit object_ is the unit of the tensor product, i.e. $a\otimes u\simeq a$ and $u\otimes a\simeq a$ for any $a$ in the category.

## Examples
- In $\text{Vect}_K$, the unit object is $K$, regarded as a vector space over itself.
- The unit object of the category of linear representations over $\text{Vect}_K$ is the trivial representation which sends each $g\in G$ to the identity automorphism on $K$. [Representation of a group](<notes/ntpy/Definitions/Representation Theory/Representation of a group.md>)
