# Definition
Let $A$ be the object of some category.

**Definition.** A *subobject* of $A$ is an equivalence class of [monomorphisms](<notes/ntpy/Definitions/Category theory/Mono, epimorphisms.md>) with codomain $A$. Dually, a *quotient object* is an equivalence class of [epimorphisms](<notes/ntpy/Definitions/Category theory/Mono, epimorphisms.md>) with domain $A$.
