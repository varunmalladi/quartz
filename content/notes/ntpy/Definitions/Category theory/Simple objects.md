title: "Simple objects"
---

# Definition
Let us work in a category with a [zero object](ntpy/Definitions/Category theory/Zero object.md).

**Definition.** A *simple* object $A$ is one whose only [quotient objects](ntpy/Definitions/Category theory/Subobjects, quotient objects.md) are $A$ and $0$.

# Examples
1. In $\text{Vect}_k$, the only simple object up to isomorphism is $k$ itself. 
	1. Any vector space of higher dimension can be mapped surjectively to one of lower non-zero dimension. $k$ can only be mapped surjectively to itself or to 0.
