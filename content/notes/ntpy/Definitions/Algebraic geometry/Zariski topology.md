title: "Zariski topology"

# Definition
## On affine space
Closed sets are the [algebraic subsets](notes/ntpy/Definitions/Algebraic geometry/Algebraic subset.md).
## On projective space
When defined on [Projective space](notes/ntpy/Definitions/Algebraic geometry/Projective space.md), the closed sets are algebraic sets on projective space.

# Properties
1. If a affine algebraic set is Hausdorff, then it is finite.
	1. So spaces in Zariski topology are not in general Hausdorff
