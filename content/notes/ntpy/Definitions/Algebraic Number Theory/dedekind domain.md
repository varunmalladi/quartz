# Idea
Locally, at least away from prime ideals, a Dedekind domain looks like a [discrete valuation ring](ntpy/Definitions/Algebraic Number Theory/discrete valuation ring.md). In particular, they are locally [PID](ntpy/Definitions/Ring theory/Principal ideal domain.md)s.

# Definition
Let $\mathcal{O}$ be a [Noetherian](ntpy/Definitions/Ring theory/Noetherian ring.md) integrally closed domain, and $k$ be its field of fractions.

The following are equivalent characterizations of a Dedekind domain:
1. Any nonzero prime ideal is maximal
2. For any nonzero prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}\subset\mathcal{O}$, the local ring $\mathcal{O}_\mathfrak{p}$ is a d.v.r.
3. For any [fractional ideal](ntpy/Definitions/Algebraic Number Theory/fractional ideal.md) $I\subset k$, we have $I^{-1}I=\mathcal{O}$.

Notice (1) is also a property shared by [Artinian rings](ntpy/Definitions/Ring theory/Artinian ring.md).

# Properties
Let $\mathcal{O}$ be a Dedekind domain
1. The fractional ideals $I\subset k$ form a commutative group under multiplication, denoted $\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{O})$, which is freely generated by the prime ideals of $\mathcal{O}$.
2. If $I\subset k$ is a fractional ideal, then $$I=\prod_\mathfrak{p}\mathfrak{p}^{v_\mathfrak{p}(I)}$$ (which is a finite product)
3. For all $\mathfrak{p}$, $$I\mathcal{O}_\mathfrak{p}=(\mathfrak{p}\mathcal{O}_\mathfrak{p})^{v_\mathfrak{p}(I)}$$
4. Suppose $N\subset K$ is an arbitrary $\mathcal{O}$-submodule. Then $$N=\bigcap_\mathfrak{p}N_\mathfrak{p}$$
5. The [integral closure](ntpy/Definitions/Ring theory/integral extensions.md) $\mathcal{O}_K$ is a Dedekind domain.
6. Suppose $\mathfrak{p}\subset\mathcal{O}$ is a prime ideal. Then $(\mathcal{O}_K)_\mathfrak{p}$ is the integral closure of $\mathcal{O}_\mathfrak{p}$ in $K$, i.e. $$(\mathcal{O}_K)_\mathfrak{p}=(\mathcal{O}_p)_K$$
7. For any prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}\subset\mathcal{O}$, there exists a prime ideal $\mathfrak{B}\subset\mathcal{O}_K$ [lying over](ntpy/Definitions/Ring theory/Prime ideal.md) it, i.e. $\mathfrak{B}\mid\mathfrak{p}$. 
	1. Conversely, for any nonzero prime ideal $\mathfrak{B}\subset\mathcal{O}_K$, we have $\mathfrak{B}\cap\mathcal{O}\neq(0)$.
8. (compare to property 3 in complete dvr's at [discrete valuation ring](ntpy/Definitions/Algebraic Number Theory/discrete valuation ring.md)) $$n=\sum e_if_i$$ (see also [residue class degree, ramification index](ntpy/Definitions/Algebraic Number Theory/residue class degree, ramification index.md))

## Proofs
**2**
Suppose $I\subset\mathcal{O}$ is a nontrivial nonzero ideal. There exists a maximal (hence prime) ideal  $\mathfrak{p}_1\subset\mathcal{O}$ such that $I\subset\mathfrak{p}_1$. Then $I\mathfrak{p}_1^{-1}\subset\mathcal{O}$. (Recall $\mathfrak{p}_1^{-1}\coloneqq\{x\in k\mid x\mathfrak{p}_1\subset\mathcal{O}\}$.) Note also that $I\subset I\mathfrak{p}_1^{-1}$ since $I\subset\mathfrak{p}_1\subset\mathfrak{p}_1^{-1}$ since $\mathfrak{p}_1\subset\mathcal{O}$.

If $I\mathfrak{p}_1^{-1}$ is nontrivial, it is contained in a maximal ideal $\mathfrak{p}_2$ such that $I\mathfrak{p}_1^{-1}\mathfrak{p}_2^{-1}\subset\mathcal{O}$ and $I\mathfrak{p}_1^{-1}\subset I\mathfrak{p}_1^{-1}\mathfrak{p}_2^{-1}$. We thus obtain a chain $$I\subset I\mathfrak{p}_1^{-1}\subset I\mathfrak{p}_1^{-1}\mathfrak{p}_2^{-1}\subset\cdots$$ Because all of these are in $\mathcal{O}$ which is Noetherian, this chain stabilizes hence comes to a trivial ideal in a finite number of steps.
