title: "Characteristic of a Field"
---

Let $K$ be any field. Consider the ring homomorphism 

\begin{gathered}
\mathbb{Z}\overset{i}{\longrightarrow}{K} \\
1\mapsto 1_K
\end{gathered}.

$\text{ker}(i)$ is an ideal of $\mathbb{Z}$, and must be principal since every ideal in $\mathbb{Z}$ is principal (has a generator). The nonnegative generator of $\text{ker}(i)$ is called the **characteristic** of $K$ and denoted $\text{char}(K)$. 

Alternatively, the **characteristic** is the minimal positive integer $p$ such that $p\cdot 1 = 1+\cdots + 1=0$, or if no such integer exists then it is $0$. 

## Characteristic is 0 or prime
**Lemma.** The characteristic of a field is 0 or prime.

_Pf._ $i(\mathbb{Z})$ is an ideal of $K$. Note that $i(\mathbb{Z})=\mathbb{Z}/\text{ker}(i)$ is an integral domain, since every subring of a field is an integral domain [(thm.)](<notes/ntpy/Theorems/Field Theory/Subring of Field is Integral Domain.md>). It follows that $i(\mathbb{Z})$ is a prime ideal domain [(thm.)](<notes/ntpy/Theorems/Ring Theory/Quotient of Ring is Integral Domain iff Prime Ideal.md>). In $\mathbb{Z}$, these are generated by $0$ or by a prime $p$.
