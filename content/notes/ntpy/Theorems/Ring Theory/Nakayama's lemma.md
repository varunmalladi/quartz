**Corollary. (Nakayama's lemma).** Let $I$ be an ideal contained in the [Jacobson radical](ntpy/Definitions/Ring theory/Radical.md) of a ring $R$, and let $M$ be a finitely generated $R$-[module](ntpy/Definitions/Ring theory/Module.md). Then 
1. If $IM=M$, then $M=0$.
2. If $m_1,\dots,m_n\in M$ have images in $M/IM$ that generate it as an $R$-module, then $m_1,\dots,m_n$ generate $M$ as an $R$-module.

**Warning.** With regards to the second statement, it is in general incorrect to conclude $M$ is finitely generated by finding finitely many generators of $M/IM$. We need those generators to be the image of (finitely many) things in $M$.

_Proof._ Apply cor. 1 from ([here](ntpy/Theorems/Cayley-Hamilton theorem.md)) to obtain an $r\in I$ such that $(1-r)M=0$. But notice that $r$ is in $I$ which is in the Jacobson radical, hence $r$ is in every maximal ideal. That means $1-r$ is not in any maximal ideal, i.e. $1-r$ is a [unit](ntpy/Definitions/Ring theory/Unit (ring).md). But then $(1-r)M=M=0$, so $M=0$.

## Corollaries
1. If $(R,P)$ is a [local ring](ntpy/Definitions/Ring theory/Local ring.md) and $M$ is a finitely-generated $R$-module such that $M/PM=0$ (i.e. $M=PM$), then $M=0$.
	1. If $N\subset M$ is a submodule such that $PM+N=M$ then $N=M$.
