title: "Semisimplicity"
---

The a class of objects possesses the characterisitic of semisimplicity if every object can be decomposed into "simple" pieces.

## Examples
- Factorial rings [[Unique factorization domain]]
	- For instance every PID is factorial
- Representations of groups [[Representation of a group]] [[Is every gp representation completely reducible?]]
	- Every finite dimensional representation is completely reducible, it is an open question for infinite dimensional representations 
- Algebraic subsets [[Algebraic subset]]
	- Every algebraic subset can be decomposed into finitely many components. [[Algebraic subsets can be decomposed]]
