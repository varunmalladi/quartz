title: "Semisimplicity"
---

The a class of objects possesses the characterisitic of semisimplicity if every object can be decomposed into "simple" pieces.

## Examples
- Factorial rings [Unique factorization domain](notes/ntpy/Definitions/Ring theory/Unique factorization domain.md)
	- For instance every PID is factorial
- Representations of groups [Representation of a group](notes/ntpy/Definitions/Representation Theory/Representation of a group.md) [Is every gp representation completely reducible?](notes/ntpy/Questions/Is every gp representation completely reducible?.md)
	- Every finite dimensional representation is completely reducible, it is an open question for infinite dimensional representations 
- Algebraic subsets [Algebraic subset](notes/ntpy/Definitions/Algebraic geometry/Algebraic subset.md)
	- Every algebraic subset can be decomposed into finitely many components. [Algebraic subsets can be decomposed](notes/ntpy/Key Ideas/Algebraic geometry/Algebraic subsets can be decomposed.md)
