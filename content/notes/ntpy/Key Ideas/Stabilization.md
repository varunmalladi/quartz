title: "Stabilization"
---

The phenomena where an infinite process terminates.

### Examples
- Nilpotent elements in a ring stabilize under the operation of taking powers [Nilpotent](notes/ntpy/Definitions/Ring theory/Nilpotent.md)
- Noetherian rings satsify the ascending chain condition, meaning every infinite increasing sequence of ideals stops growing at a finite stage [Noetherian ring](notes/ntpy/Definitions/Ring theory/Noetherian ring.md)
