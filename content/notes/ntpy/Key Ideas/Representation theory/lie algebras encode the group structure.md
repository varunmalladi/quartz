title: "lie algebras encode the group structure"
---

Lie groups are groups with the structure of a smooth manifold. Intuitively, this means there is a way to "connect" all the local pictures into a global one, and this is precisely what the manifold does. The idea, then, is that to understand the global picture it suffices to understand the local one, for we can somehow extend local to global. The local picture is the lie algebra.
