If a category is not semi simple, are its higher categories semisimple? I.e, does the property of semisimiplicity stabilize?

# Linear representations

The category of (finite) linear representations of a finite group (see details in [Representation of a group](<notes/ntpy/Definitions/Representation Theory/Representation of a group.md>)) is semisimple; this is the content of [Maschke's Theorem](<notes/ntpy/Theorems/Representation theory/Maschke's Theorem.md>). 

A natural starting point is to ask if the corresponding 2-category is semisimple. Let's describe this now. Calling the category of representations as specified above $C$, we wish to show that maps between representations, i.e. the morphisms of $C$, are semisimple. Let us first regard the [simple objects](<notes/ntpy/Definitions/Category theory/Simple objects.md>).
