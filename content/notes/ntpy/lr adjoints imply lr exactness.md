title: "lr adjoints imply lr exactness"
---

If the functor $F$ is left adjoint to $G$, then $F$ is right exact and $G$ is left exact.

This is a corollary of the stronger result that left adjoints preserve colimits and right adjoints preserve limits ([here](notes/ntpy/Theorems/Category theory/adjoints preserve (co)limits.md)).
