title: "Minimal polynomial"
---

# Definition
Suppose $P\in k[T]$ is irreducible of degree $\geq 1$. Then 
1. $(P)$ is a maximal ideal in $k[T]$.
	- $k_P\coloneqq k[T]/(P)$ is a field
2. $[k_P:k]=\deg P$. 
The polynomial $P$ is called the *minimal polynomial* of $k_P$.

To see (1), recall $k[T]$ is a PID, so any ideal containing $(P)$ is principal (generated by a single element). In particular that single element would generate $P$, and since $P$ is irreducible this implies that the single element is $P$ itself.

To see (2), consider the Euclidean algorithm. Any polynomial $f\in k[T]$ can be written as $f(T)=g(T)P(T)+h(T)$, where $0\leq \deg h(T)<\deg P(T)$. The possible values of $h(T)$ is isomorphic to $k[T]/(P)$. It is spanned by $1,T,\dots,T^{\deg P-1}$. 

# Properties
Let $E/F$ be a finite [Field extension](ntpy/Definitions/Algebraic Number Theory/Field Theory/Field extension.md). Let $\alpha\in E$. 

1. The minimal polynomial of $\alpha$ is unique. 

*Proofs*
**1**
Consider the ring homomorphism
$$
\begin{gather}
FX[]()\to E \\
f(X)\mapsto f(\alpha). 
\end{gather}
$$
Denote the kernel by $J_\alpha$; it is the set of all polynomials in $F[X]$ that have $\alpha$ as a root. By the properties of ring homomorphisms, $J_\alpha$ is an ideal. But also $F[X]$ is a principal ring, hence there exists a polynomial $P$ that generates $J_\alpha$. Clearly this must have minimal degree among all nonzero elements of $J_\alpha$. Now suppose $Q\in J_\alpha$ has the same degree as $P$. Then $P-Q\in J_\alpha$ has degree less than $P$, but since $P$ has minimal degree this means $P-Q=0$ and so $P=Q$.
